  <title>Limits and Continuity</title>
  <p>
    Let <m>u=u(x, y)</m> be a real-valued function of the two real variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    Recall that <m>u</m> has the limit <m>u_0</m> as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches
    <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> provided the value of <m>u(x,y)</m> can be made to get as close as we want to the value <m>u_0</m> by taking <m>(x, y)</m> to be sufficiently close to <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
    When this happens we write
    <me>
      \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} u(x, y) = u_0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In more technical language,
    <m>u</m> has the limit <m>u_0</m> as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> iff
    <m>|u(x, y) -u_0|</m> can be made arbitrarily small by making both <m>|x-x_0|</m> and <m>|y-y_0|</m> small.
    This condition is like the definition of a limit for functions of one variable.
    The point <m>(x, y)</m> is in the <m>xy</m> plane,
    and the distance between <m>(x, y)</m> and
    <m>(x_0 y_0)</m> is <m>\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}</m>.
    With this perspective we can now give a precise definition of a limit.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <title>Limit of <m>\mathbf{u(x,y)}</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The expression <m>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)}u(x, y)=u_0</m> means that for each number <m>\varepsilon > 0</m>,
        there is a corresponding number <m>\delta > 0</m> such that
        <men xml:id="lim">
          |u(x, y) - u_0| \lt  \varepsilon  \text{ whenever }   0\lt \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2} \lt \delta
        </men>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show, if <m>u(x, y) =\frac{2x^3}{(x^2+y^2)}</m>,
        then <m>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}</m> <m>u(x, y) = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If <m>x=r\cos \theta</m> and <m>y=r\sin \theta</m>, then
        <me>
          u(x, y) = \frac{2r^3\cos ^3\theta}{r^2\cos ^2\theta +r^2\sin ^2\theta} = 2r\cos^3\theta
        </me>.
        Because <m>\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2}=r</m> and because <m>|\cos ^3\theta |\lt 1</m>,
        <me>
          |u(x, y) -0|=2r|\cos ^3\theta |\lt \varepsilon \ \ \text{ whenever } 0\lt \sqrt{x^2+y^2}=r\lt  \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
        </me>.
        Hence, for any <m>\varepsilon >0</m>, Inequality <xref ref="lim"/> is satisfied for <m>\delta =\frac{\varepsilon}{2}</m>;
        that is, <m>u(x, y)</m> has the limit <m>u_0=0</m> as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(0, 0)</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    The value <m>u_0</m> of the limit must not depend on how <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>,
    so <m>u(x, y)</m> must approach the value <m>u_0</m> when <m>(x, y)</m> approaches
    <m>(x_0,\,y_0)</m> along any curve that ends at the point <m>(x_0,\,y_0)</m>.
    Conversely, if we can find two curves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> that end at
    <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> along which <m>u(x, y)</m> approaches two distinct values <m>u_1</m> and <m>u_2</m>,
    then <m>u(x, y)</m> does not have a limit as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that the function <m>u(x, y) =\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}</m> does not have a limit as <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(0, 0)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If we let <m>(x, y)</m> approach <m>(0, 0)</m> along the <m>x</m> axis, then
        <me>
          \lim\limits_{(x,0) \to (0,0)} u(x, 0) = \lim\limits_{(x,0) \to (0,0)}\frac{(x)(0)}{x^2+0^2} = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if we let <m>(x, y)</m> approach <m>(0,\,0)</m> along the line <m>y=x</m>, then
        <me>
          \lim\limits_{(x,x) \to (0,0)}u(x, x) = \lim\limits_{(x,x) \to (0, 0)}\frac{(x)(x)}{x^2+x^2}=\frac{1}{2}
        </me>.
        Because the value of the limit differs depending on how <m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(0, 0)</m>,
        we conclude that <m>u(x, y)</m> does not have a limit as<nbsp/><m>(x, y)</m> approaches <m>(0, 0)</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    Let <m>f(z)</m> be a complex function of the complex variable <m>z</m> that is defined for all values of <m>z</m> in some neighborhood of <m>z_0</m>,
    except perhaps at the point <m>z_0</m>.
    We say that <m>f</m> has the limit <m>w_0</m> as <m>z</m> approaches <m>z_0</m>,
    provided the value <m>f(z)</m> can be made as close as we want to the value <m>w_0</m> by taking <m>z</m> to be sufficiently close to <m>z_0</m>.
    When this happens we write
    <me>
      \lim\limits_{z \to z_0}f(z) =w_0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The distance between the points <m>z</m> and <m>z_0</m> can be expressed by <m>|z-z_0|</m>,
    so we can give a precise definition similar to the one for a function of two variables.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="LimitDef">
    <title>Limit of <m>\mathbf{f(z)}</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The expression <m>\lim\limits_{z \to z_0}f(z) = w_0</m> means that for each real number <m>\varepsilon > 0</m>,
        there exists a real number <m>\delta >0</m> such that
        <me>
          |f(z) -w_0|\lt \varepsilon  \text{ whenever }   0\lt  |z-z_0| \lt \delta
        </me>.
        Using the notation of <xref ref="OpenDisk"/> and <xref ref="PuncturedDisk"/>, we can express the last relationship as
        <me>
          f(z) \in D_{\varepsilon}(w_0)  \text{ whenever }   z \in D_{\delta}^*(z_0)
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The formulation of limits in terms of open disks provides a good context for looking at this definition.
    It says that for each disk of radius
    <m>\varepsilon</m> about the point <m>w_0</m> (represented by
    <m>D_{\varepsilon}(w_0)</m>) there is a punctured disk of radius <m>\delta</m> about the point <m>z_0</m> (represented by
    <m>D_{\delta}^*(z_0)</m>) such that the image of each point in the punctured <m>\delta</m> disk lies in the <m>\varepsilon</m> disk.
    The image of the <m>\delta</m> disk does not have to fill up the entire <m>\varepsilon</m> disk;
    but if <m>z</m> approaches <m>z_0</m> along a curve that ends at <m>z_0</m>,
    then <m>w=f(z)</m> approaches <m>w_0</m>.
    The situation is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_ch-02-17">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-02-17">

    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that if <m>f(z) = \overline{z}</m>,
        then <m>\lim\limits_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \overline{z_0}</m>,
        where <m>z_0</m> is any complex number.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        As <m>f</m> merely reflects points about the <m>y</m> axis,
        we suspect that any <m>\varepsilon</m> disk about the point
        <m>\overline{z_0}</m> would contain the image of the punctured <m>\delta</m> disk about <m>z_0</m> if <m>\delta =\varepsilon</m>.
        To confirm this conjecture,
        we let <m>\varepsilon</m> be any positive number and set <m>\delta =\varepsilon</m>.
        Then we suppose that <m>z\in D_{\delta}^*(z_0) =D_{\varepsilon}^*(z_0)</m>,
        which means that <m>0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \varepsilon</m>.
        The modulus of a conjugate is the same as the modulus of the number itself,
        so the last inequality implies that <m>0\lt |\overline{z-z_0}| \lt \varepsilon</m>.
        This inequality is the same as <m>0\lt |\overline{z}-\overline{ z_0}|\lt \varepsilon</m>.
        Since <m>f(z) =\overline{z}</m> and <m>w_0=\overline{z_0}</m>,
        this last inequality becomes <m>0\lt |f(z) - w_0|\lt \varepsilon</m>,
        or <m>f(z)\in D_{\varepsilon}(\overline{z_0})</m>,
        which is what we needed to show.

  <p>
    If we consider <m>w=f(z)</m> as a mapping from the <m>z</m> plane into the <m>w</m> plane and think about the previous geometric interpretation of a limit,
    then we are led to conclude that the limit of a function <m>f</m> should be determined by the limits of its real and imaginary parts,
    <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
    This conclusion also gives us a tool for computing limits.

        </men>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We first assume that Statement <xref ref="complex_limit"/> is true and show that Statement <xref ref="real_limit"/> is true.
      According to the definition of limit,
      for each <m>\varepsilon >0</m>,
      there is a corresponding <m>\delta >0</m> such that
      <me>
        f(z) \in D_{\varepsilon}(w_0)  \text{ whenever }   z \in D_{\delta}^*(z_0)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      ; that is,
      <me>
        |f(z)-w_0|\lt \varepsilon  \text{ whenever }   0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \delta
      </me>.
      Because <m>f(z) -w_0=u(x, y) -u_0+i(v(x, y) -v_0)</m>,
      we can use Inequalities <xref ref="ReImLEMod"/> to conclude that
      <me>
        |u(x, y) -u_0| \le |f(z)-w_0|  \text{ and }   |v(x, y)-v_0| \le |f(z)-w_0|
      </me>.
      It now follows that <m>|u(x, y) -u_0|\lt \varepsilon</m> and
      <m>|v(x, y) -v_0|\lt \varepsilon</m> whenever <m>0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \delta</m>,
      and so Statement <xref ref="real_limit"/> is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, assume that Statement <xref ref="real_limit"/> is true.
      Then for each <m>\varepsilon >0</m>,
      there exists <m>\delta _1>0</m> and <m>\delta_2>0</m> so that
      <md>
        <mrow>|u(x, y) -u_0|\amp  \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \text{ whenever } 0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \delta _1, \ \ \text{ and }</mrow>
        <mrow>|v(x, y) -v_0|\amp  \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \text{ whenever } 0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \delta _2</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We choose <m>\delta</m> to be the minimum of the two values
      <m>\delta _1</m> and <m>\delta _2</m>.
      Then we can use the triangle inequality
      <me>
        |f(z) -w_0|\le |u(x, y) -u_0|+|v(x, y)-v_0|
      </me>
      to conclude that
      <me>
        |f(z) -w_0|\lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{ \varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon  \text{ whenever }   0\lt |z-z_0|\lt \delta
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      ; that is,
      <me>
        f(z) \in D_{\varepsilon}(w_0)  \text{ whenever }   z\in D_{\delta}^*(z_0)
      </me>.
      Hence the truth of Statement <xref ref="real_limit"/> implies the truth of Statement <xref ref="complex_limit"/>, and the proof of the theorem is complete.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>\lim\limits_{z \to 1+i}</m> <m>(z^2-2z+1) = -1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let
        <me>
          f(z) =z^2-2z+1=x^2-y^2-2x+1+i(2xy-2y)
        </me>.
        Computing the limits for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (1,1)}u(x, y) \amp  =1-1-2+1=-1\ \ \text{ and }</mrow>
          <mrow>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (1,1)}v(x, y) \amp  =2-2=0</mrow>
        </md>,
        so our previous theorem implies that <m>\lim\limits_{z \to 1+i}</m> <m>f(z) = -1</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>

    Limits of complex functions are formally the same as those of real functions,

    We state this result as a theorem and leave the proof as an exercise.

    A complex function <m>f</m> is continuous iff its real and imaginary parts,

    The proof of this fact is an immediate consequence of <xref ref="ReC_Limit_Thm">Theorem</xref>.
    Continuity of complex functions is formally the same as that of real functions,

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that the polynomial function given by
        <me>
          w=P(z) =a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+\cdots +a_nz^n
        </me>
        is continuous at each point <m>z_0</m> in the complex plane.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If <m>a_0</m> is the constant function,
        then <m>\lim\limits_{z \to z_0}a_0 = a_0</m>;
        and if <m>a_1 \ne 0</m>,
        then we can use <xref ref="LimitDef">Definition</xref>
        with <m>f(z) =a_1z</m> and the choice
        <m>\delta =\frac{\varepsilon}{|a_1|}</m> to prove that <m>\lim\limits_{z \to z_0}(a_1z) = a_1z_0</m>.
        Using Property <xref ref="limproduct"/> and mathematical induction,
        we obtain
        <men xml:id="limproducts">
          \lim\limits_{z \to z_0}(a_kz^k) =a_kz_0^k  \text{ for }   k=0,1,2,\ldots,n
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can extend Property <xref ref="limsum"/> to a finite sum of terms and use the result of Equation <xref ref="limproducts"/> to get
        <me>
          \lim\limits_{z \to z_0}P(z)=\lim\limits_{z \to z_0}\left(\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_kz^k\right)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_kz_0^k = P(z_0)
        </me>.
        Conditions <xref ref="Ccont_1"/>,
        <xref ref="Ccont_2"/>, and <xref ref="Ccont_3"/> are satisfied,
        so we conclude that <m>P</m> is continuous at <m>z_0</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    One technique for computing limits is to apply <xref ref="ContThm">Theorem</xref> to quotients.
    If we let <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> be polynomials and if <m>Q(z_0) \ne 0</m>, then
    <me>
      \lim\limits_{z \to z_0}\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}= \frac{P(z_0)}{Q(z_0)}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Another technique involves factoring polynomials.
    If both <m>P(z_0) =0</m> and <m>Q(z_0) =0</m>,
    then <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> can be factored as
    <m>P(z) = (z-z_0) P_1(z)</m> and <m>Q(z)= (z-z_0)Q_1(z)</m>.
    If <m>Q_1(z_0) \ne 0</m>, then the limit is
    <me>
      \lim_{z \to z_0}\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} = \lim_{z \to z_0}\frac{(z-z_0) P_1(z)}{(z-z_0) Q_1(z)} = \frac{P_1(z_0)}{Q_1(z_0)}
    </me>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>\lim\limits_{z \to 1+i}\frac{z^2-2i}{z^2-2z+2}=1-i</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Here <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> can be factored in the form
        <me>
          P(z) =(z-1-i) (z+1+i)  \text{ and }   Q(z) = (z-1-i)(z-1+i)
        </me>
        so that the limit is obtained by the calculation
        <md>
          <mrow>\lim\limits_{z \to 1+i}\left(\frac{z^2-2i}{z^2-2z+2}\right) \amp  =\lim\limits_{z \to 1+i}\frac{(z-1-i)(z+1+i)}{(z-1-i) (z-1+i)}</mrow>
