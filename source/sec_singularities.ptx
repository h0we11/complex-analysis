  <title>Singularities, Zeros, and Poles</title>
  <p>
    Recall that the point <m>\alpha</m> is called a singular point,
    or singularity,
    of the complex function <m>f</m> if <m>f</m> is not analytic at the point <m>\alpha</m>,
    but every neighborhood <m>D_{R}(\alpha)</m> of <m>\alpha</m> contains at least one point at which <m>f</m> is analytic.
    For example,
    the function <m>f(z) =\frac{1}{1-z}</m> is not analytic at
    <m>\alpha=1</m> but is analytic for all other values of <m>z</m>.
    Thus the point <m>\alpha=1</m> is a singular point of <m>f</m>.
    As another example, consider the function <m>g(z) =</m> Log <m>z</m>.
    We showed in Section 5.2 that <m>g</m> is analytic for all <m>z</m> except at the origin and at the points on the negative real axis.
    Thus the origin and each point on the negative real axis are singularities of <m>g</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point <m>\alpha</m> is called an isolated singularity of a complex function <m>f</m> if <m>f</m> is not analytic at <m>\alpha</m> but there exists a real number <m>R>0</m> such that <m>f</m> is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk <m>D_{R}^{\ast }(\alpha)</m>.
    The function <m>f(z) =\frac{1 }{1-z}</m> has an isolated singularity at <m>\alpha =1</m>.
    The function <m>g(z) =</m> Log <m>z</m>, however,
    has a singularity at <m>\alpha =0</m>
    (or at any point of the negative real axis)
    that is not isolated,
    because any neighborhood of <m>\alpha</m> contains points on the negative real axis,
    and <m>g</m> is not analytic at those points.
    Functions with isolated singularities have a Laurent series because the punctured disk
    <m>D_{R}^{\ast }(\alpha)</m> is the same as the annulus <m>A(\alpha ,0,R)</m>.
    We now look at this special case of Laurent's theorem in order to classify three types of isolated singularities.

    <title>Classification of singularities</title>

    Let's investigate some examples of these three cases.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <title>i</title>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> has a removable singularity at <m>\alpha</m>,
          then it has a Laurent series
          <me>
            f(z) =\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(z-\alpha)^n,  \text{ valid for all }  z \in A(\alpha,0,R)
          </me>.
          <xref ref="Power_Series_Thm">Theorem</xref>
          implies that the power series for <m>f</m> defines an analytic function in the disk <m>D_{R}(\alpha)</m>.
          If we use this series to define <m>f(\alpha) =c_0</m>,
          then the function <m>f</m> becomes analytic at
          <m>z=\alpha</m>, removing the singularity.
          For example,
          consider the function <m>f(z) =\frac{\sin z}{z}</m>.
          It is undefined at <m>z=0</m> and has an isolated singularity at <m>z=0</m>,
          as the Laurent series for <m>f</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>f(z)  \amp = \frac{\sin z}{z}=\frac{1}{z}(z-\frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^{5}}{5!}-\frac{z^{7}}{7!}+\cdots)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  =1-\frac{z^2}{3!}+\frac{z^4}{5!}-\frac{z^{6}}{7!}+\cdots,  \text{ valid for }  |z| > 0</mrow>
          </md>.
          We can remove this singularity if we define <m>f(0)=1</m>,
          for then <m>f</m> will be analytic at <m>0</m> in accordance with <xref ref="Power_Series_Thm">Theorem</xref>.
          Another example is <m>g(z)=\frac{\cos z-1}{z^2}</m>,
          which has an isolated singularity at the point <m>0</m>,
          as the Laurent series for <m>g</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>g(z)  \amp = \frac{1}{z^2}\left(-\frac{z^2}{2!}+\frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^{6}}{6!}+\cdots\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{z^2}{4!}-\frac{z^4}{6!}+\cdots,  \text{ valid for } |z| >0</mrow>
          </md>.
          If we define <m>g(0) =-\frac{1}{2}</m>,
          then <m>g</m> will be analytic for all <m>z</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>ii</title>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> has a pole of order <m>k</m> at <m>\alpha</m>,
          the Laurent series for <m>f</m> is
          <me>
            f(z) =\sum\limits_{n=-k}^{\infty}c_n(z-\alpha)^n,  \text{ valid for all }  z \in A(\alpha,0,R)
          </me>,
          where <m>c_{-k} \ne 0</m>.
          For example,
          <me>
            f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z^3}=\frac{1}{z^2}-\frac{1}{3!}+\frac{z^2}{5!}-\frac{z^4}{7!}+\cdots
          </me>
          has a pole of order 2 at <m>0</m>.
          If <m>f</m> has a pole of order 1 at <m>\alpha</m>,
          we say that <m>f</m> has a simple pole at <m>\alpha</m>.
          For example,
          <me>
            f(z) = \frac{1}{z}e^z=\frac{1}{z}+1+\frac{z}{2!}+\frac{z^2}{3!} + \cdots
          </me>,
          which has a simple pole at <m>0</m>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>iii</title>
        <p>
          If infinitely many negative powers of
          <m>(z-\alpha)</m> occur in the Laurent series,
          then <m>f</m> has an essential singularity at <m>\alpha</m>.
          For example,
          <me>
            f(z) = z^2\sin\frac{1}{z}=z-\frac{1}{3!}z^{-1}+\frac{1}{5!}z^{-3}-\frac{1}{7!}z^{-5}+\cdots

      <p>
        In <xref ref="sec_trig-hyperbolics">Section</xref>
        we saw that the zeros of <m>f(z) =\sin z</m> occur at the points <m>n\pi</m>,
        where <m>n</m> is an integer.
        Because <m>f\,'(n\pi) = \cos n\pi \ne 0</m>,
        the zeros of <m>f</m> are simple.
        Similarly, the function <m>g(z) = z\cos z</m> has simple zeros at the points <m>0</m> and <m>(n+\frac{1}{2}) \pi</m>,
        where <m>n</m> is an integer.
        From the information given,
        we find that <m>h(z) = \frac{f(z)}{g(z)}</m> behaves as follows:
