  <title>Analytic and Harmonic Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Does the notion of a derivative of a complex function make any sense?
      If so, how should it be defined and what does it represent?
      These and similar questions are the focus of this chapter.
      As you might guess, complex derivatives have a meaningful definition,
      and many of the standard derivative theorems from calculus
      (such as the product rule and chain rule)
      carry over.
      There are also some interesting applications.
      But not everything is symmetric.
      You will learn in this chapter that the mean value theorem for derivatives does not extend to complex functions.
      In later chapters you will see that differentiable complex functions are,
      in some sense,
      much more
      <q>differentiable</q>
      than differentiable real functions.
