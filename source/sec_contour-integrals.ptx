  <title>Contours and Contour Integrals</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_complex-integrals">Section</xref>
    we showed how to evaluate integrals of the form <m>\int_a^bf(t) \ dt</m>,
    where <m>f</m> was complex-valued and
    <m>\left[ a,\,b\right]</m> was an interval on the real axis
    (so that <m>t</m> was real, with <m>t\in \left[ a,\,b\right]</m>).
    In this section,
    we define and evaluate integrals of the form <m>\int_cf (z) \,dz</m>,
    where <m>f</m> is complex-valued and <m>C</m> is a contour in the plane (so that <m>z</m> is complex,
    with <m>z\in C</m>).<xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref> provides our main result,
    which shows how to transform the latter type of integral into the kind we investigated in <xref ref="sec_complex-integrals">Section</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use concepts first introduced in <xref ref="sec_topology">Section</xref>.
    Recall that to represent a curve <m>C</m> in the plane we use the parametric notation
    <men xml:id="review-curve">
      C:z(t)=x(t) +iy(t),  \text{ for }   a \le t \le b
    </men>,
    where <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are continuous functions.
    We now place a few more restrictions on the type of curve to be described.
    The following discussion leads to the concept of a contour,
    which is a type of curve that is adequate for the study of integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that <m>C</m> is <em>simple</em>
    if it does not cross itself,
    which means that <m>z(t_1) \ne z(t_2)</m> whenever <m>t_1 \ne t_2</m>,
    except possibly when <m>t_1 = a</m> and <m>t_2=b</m>.
    A curve <m>C</m> with the property <m>z(b)=z(a)</m> is a closed curve.
    If <m>z(b)=z(a)</m> is the only point of intersection,
    then we say that <m>C</m> is a simple closed curve.
    As the parameter <m>t</m> increases from the value <m>a</m> to the value <m>b</m>,
    the point <m>z(t)</m> starts at the
    <em>initial point</em> <m>z(a)</m>,
    moves along the curve <m>C</m>,
    and ends up at the <em>terminal point</em> <m>z(b)</m>.
    If <m>C</m> is simple,
    then <m>z(t)</m> moves continuously from <m>z(a)</m> to <m>z(b)</m> as <m>t</m> increases and the curve is given an <em>orientation</em>,
    which we indicate by drawing arrows along the curve.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-06-01">Figure</xref>
    illustrates how the terms <em>simple</em>
    and <em>closed</em> describe a curve.

  <p>
    The complex-valued function
    <m>z(t)=x(t) +iy(t)</m> is said to be <em>differentiable</em>
    on <m>[a,b]</m> if both <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are differentiable for <m>a \le t \le b</m>.
    Here we require the one-sided derivatives<fn>
    The derivatives on the right, <m>x\,'(a^+)</m>,
    and on the left, <m>x\,'(b^{-})</m>, are defined by the limits
    <me>
      x\,'(a^+)=\lim\limits_{t \to a^+}\frac{x(t)-x(a)}{t-a}  \text{ and }   x\,'(b^-) = \lim\limits_{t \to b^-}\frac{x(t) -x(b)}{t-b}
    </me>.
    </fn> of <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> to exist at the endpoints of the interval.
    As in <xref ref="sec_complex-integrals">Section</xref>,
    the derivative <m>z\,'(t)</m> is
    <me>
      z\,'(t)=x\,'(t) + iy\,'(t),  \text{ for }   a \le t \le b
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The curve <m>C</m> defined by Equation <xref ref="review-curve"/> is said to be a smooth curve if the function <m>z\,'</m> is continuous and nonzero on the interval.
    If <m>C</m> is a smooth curve,
    then <m>C</m> has a nonzero tangent vector at each point <m>z(t)</m>,
    which is given by the vector <m>z\,'(t)</m>.
    If <m>x\,'(t_0)=0</m>,
    then the tangent vector <m>z\,'(t_0)=iy\,'(t_0)</m> is vertical.
    If <m>x\,'(t_0) \ne 0</m>,
    then the slope <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> of the tangent line to <m>C</m> at the point <m>z(t_0)</m> is given by <m>\frac{{y\,'(t_0)}}{x\,'(t_0)}</m>.
    Hence for a smooth curve the angle of inclination
    <m>\theta (t)</m> of its tangent vector <m>z\,'(t)</m> is defined for all values of <m>t\in [a,b]</m> and is continuous.
    Thus a smooth curve has no corners or cusps.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-06-02">Figure</xref> illustrates this concept.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-02">
    <caption>The term <em>smooth</em> used to describe curves</caption>
    <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-06/ch-06-fig-02.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    If <m>C</m> is a smooth curve,
    then <m>ds</m>, the differential of arc length, is given by
    <me>
      ds=\sqrt{[x\,'(t)^2 + [y\,'(t)]^2} \, dt=|z\,'(t)| \, dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The function <m>s(t)=\sqrt{x\,'(t)^2 + y\,'(t)^2}</m> is continuous because <m>x\,'</m> and <m>y\,'</m> are continuous functions,
    so the length <m>L(C)</m> of the curve <m>C</m> is
    <men xml:id="Curve_Length">
      L(C)=\int_a^b\sqrt{[x\,'(t)]^2 + [y\,'(t)]^2}\,dt = \int_a^b|z\,'(t)|\,dt
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, consider <m>C</m> to be a curve with parametrization
    <me>
      C:z_1(t)=x(t)+iy(t)  \text{ for }   a \le t \le b
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The opposite curve <m>-C</m> traces out the same set of points in the plane,
    but in the reverse order, and has the parametrization
    <me>
      -C:z_2(t)=x(-t)+iy(-t)  \text{ for }   -b \le t \le -a
    </me>.
    Since <m>z_2(t)=z_1(-t)</m>,
    <m>-C</m> is merely <m>C</m> traversed in the opposite sense,
    as <xref ref="fig_ch-06-03">Figure</xref> illustrates.
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    A curve <m>C</m> that is constructed by joining finitely many smooth curves end to end is called a contour.
    Let <m>C_1,\,C_2,\ldots ,\,C_n</m> denote <m>n</m> smooth curves such that the terminal point of the curve <m>C_k</m> coincides with the initial point of <m>C_{k+1}</m>,
    for <m>k=1,\,2,\ldots \,,n-1</m>.
    We express the contour <m>C</m> by the equation
    <me>
      C=C_1+C_2+\cdots +C_n
    </me>.
    A synonym for <em>contour</em> is <em>path</em>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a parametrization of the polygonal path <m>C</m> from <m>-1+i</m> to <m>3-i</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-04">Figure</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We express <m>C</m> as three smooth curves, or <m>C=C_1+C_2+C_3</m>.
        If we set <m>z_0=-1+i</m> and <m>z_1=-1</m>,
        we can use <xref ref="Curvez0z1">Equation</xref>
        to get a formula for the straight-line segment joining two points:
        <me>
          C_1:z_1(t) = z_0+t(z_1-z_0) = (-1+i)+t[-1-(-1+i)],  \text{ for }   0 \le t \le 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When simplified, this formula becomes
        <me>
          C_1:z_1(t)=-1+i(1-t),  \text{ for }   0 \le t \le 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the segments <m>C_2</m> and <m>C_3</m> are given by
        <md>

    We are now ready to define the integral of a complex function along a contour <m>C</m> in the plane with initial point <m>A</m> and terminal point <m>B</m>.
    Our approach is to mimic what is done in calculus.
    We create a partition <m>P_n=\{ z_0=A,z_1,z_2,\,.\,.\,.\,,z_n=B\}</m> of points that proceed along <m>C</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> and form the differences <m>\Delta z_k=z_k-z_{k-1}</m>,
    for <m>k=1,\,2,\,.\,.\,.\,,\,n</m>.
    Between each pair of partition points <m>z_{k-1}</m> and <m>z_k</m> we select a point <m>c_k</m> on <m>C</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-05">Figure</xref>,
    and evaluate the function <m>f</m>.
    We use these values to make a Riemann sum for the partition:
    <men xml:id="Riemann_Sum">
      S(P_n)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(c_k)(z_k-z_{k-1})=\sum_{k=1}^nf(c_k)\Delta z_k
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assume now that there exists a unique complex number <m>L</m> that is the limit of every sequence
    <m>\{S(P_n)\}</m> of Riemann sums given in Equation <xref ref="Riemann_Sum"/>,
    where the maximum of <m>|\Delta z_k|</m> tends toward 0 for the sequence of partitions.
    That number is the value of the integral of the function <m>f</m> along <m>C</m>.

        Let <m>C</m> be a contour.
        Then

          \int_Cf(z)\,dt = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(c_k) \Delta z_k

  <p>
    In <xref ref="Contoe_fnt_Def">Definition</xref>
    the value of the integral depends on the contour.

    the Cauchy-Goursat theorem will establish the remarkable fact that,

        One possible Riemann sum, then, is

        </me>.
        By rounding the terms in this Riemann sum to two decimal digits,
        we obtain an approximation for the integral:

          <mrow>S(P_8) \amp \approx (0.28+0.13i) +(0.33+0.19i) +(0.41+0.29i) +(0.49+0.42i)</mrow>

        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This result compares favorably with the precise value of the integral,
        which you will soon see equals

          \exp\left(2+i\frac{\pi}{4}\right) -1 = -1+e^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)+ie^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \approx 4.22485+5.22485i

  <p>
    In general, obtaining an exact value for an integral given by <xref ref="Contoe_fnt_Def">Definition</xref> could be a daunting task.
    Fortunately,
    there is a beautiful theory that allows for an easy computation of many contour integrals.
    Suppose that we have a parametrization of the contour <m>C</m> given by the function <m>z(t)</m> for <m>a \le t \le b</m>.
    That is, <m>C</m> is the range of the function <m>z(t)</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
    as <xref ref="fig_ch-06-07">Figure</xref> shows.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-07">

  </figure>
  <p>
    It follows that
    <md>
      <mrow>\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^nf(c_k) \Delta z_k \amp = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(c_k) (z_k-z_{k-1})</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(z(\tau_k)) \big[z(t_k)-z(t_{k-1})\big]</mrow>
    </md>.
    where <m>\tau _k</m> and <m>t_k</m> are the points contained in the interval <m>[a,bt]</m> with the property that
    <m>c_k=z(\tau _k)</m> and <m>z_k=z(t_k)</m>,
    as is also shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-07">Figure</xref>.
    If for all <m>k</m> we multiply the <m>k</m>th term in the last sum by <m>\frac{{t_k-t_{k-1}} }{{t_k-t_{k-1}}}</m>,
    then we get
    <md>
      <mrow>\amp  \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(z(\tau_k))\left[ \frac{z(t_k) -z(t_{k-1})}{t_k-t_{k-1}}\right] (t_k-t_{k-1}) =</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^nf(z(\tau_k)) \left[\frac{z(t_k) -z(t_{k-1})}{t_k-t_{k-1}}\right] \Delta t_k</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The quotient inside the last summation looks suspiciously like a derivative,
    and the entire quantity looks like a Riemann sum.
    Assuming no difficulties,
    this last expression should equal <m>\int_a^bf(z(t) ) z\,'(t)\,dt</m>,
    as defined in <xref ref="sec_complex-integrals">Section</xref>.
    Of course, if we're to have any hope of this happening,
    we would have to get the same limit
    <em>regardless of how we parametrize the contour</em><m>C</m>.
    As <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref>
    states, this is indeed the case.

    Two important facets of <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref> are worth mentioning.
    First, <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref>
    makes the problem of evaluating complex-valued functions along contours easy,
    as it reduces the task to the evaluation of complex-valued functions over real intervals<mdash/>a procedure that you studied in <xref ref="sec_complex-integrals">Section</xref>.
    Second, according to Theorem 6.1, this transformation yields the same answer regardless of the parametrization we choose for <m>C</m>.

        Recall that <m>C_1^+(2)</m> is the upper semicircle with radius 1 centered at <m>x=2</m> oriented in a positive direction
        (<em>i.e.</em>, counterclockwise).
        The function <m>z(t)=2+e^{it}</m>,
        for <m>0 \le t \le \pi</m> is a parametrization for <m>C</m>.
        We apply <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref>
        with <m>f(z)=\frac{1}{z-2}</m>. (Note:

  <p>
    To help convince yourself that the value of the integral is independent of the parametrization chosen for the given contour,
    try working through Example 6.8 with

  </p>
  <p>
    A convenient bookkeeping device can help you remember how to apply <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref>.
    Because <m>\int_Cf(z)\,dz=\int_a^bf(z(t) ) z\,'(t)\,dt</m>,
    you can symbolically equate <m>z</m> with <m>z(t)</m> and <m>dz</m> with <m>z\,'(t)\,dt</m>.
    These identities should be easy to remember because <m>z</m> is supposed to be a point on the contour <m>C</m> parametrized by <m>z(t)</m>,
    and <m>\frac{dz}{dt}=z\,'(t)</m>,
    according to the Leibniz notation for the derivative.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>z(t)=x(t) +iy(t)</m>, then by the preceding paragraph we have
    <men xml:id="dz">
      dz=z\,'(t)\,dt = \big[x\,'(t)+iy\,'(t)\big]\,dt = dx+idy
    </men>.
    where <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> are the differentials for <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>,
    respectively (<em>i.e.</em>,
    <m>dx</m> is equated with <m>x\,'(t)\,dt</m>, etc.).
    The expression <m>dz</m> is often called the
    <em>complex differential</em> of <m>z</m>.
    Just as <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> are intuitively considered to be small segments along the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes in real variables,
    we can think of <m>dz</m> as representing a tiny piece of the contour <m>C</m>.
    Moreover, if we write
    <me>
      |dz| = \big|[x\,'(t)+iy\,'(t)]\big| = \big|x\,'(t) +iy\,'(t)\big|\, dt = \sqrt{\big[x\,'(t)\big]^2 + \big[y\,'(t)\big]^2}\,dt
    </me>,
    we can put Equation <xref ref="Curve_Length"/> into the form
    <men xml:id="L_C_">
      L(C)=\int_a^b\sqrt{\big[ x'(t) \big]^2 + \big[y\,'(t)\big]^2}\,dt =\int_C|dz|
    </men>.
    so we can think of <m>\left\vert dz\right\vert</m> as representing the length of <m>dz</m>.

    Suppose that <m>f(z)=u(z) +iv(z)</m> and that

  </p>
  <p>
    If we use the differentials given in Equation <xref ref="dz"/>,
    then we can write Equation <xref ref="Line_Int"/> in terms of line integrals of the real-valued functions <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, giving

    <me>
      f(z)\,dz=(u+iv)(dx+i\,dy)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We emphasize that Equation <xref ref="bookkeeping"/> is merely a notational device for applying <xref ref="thm_contour-integral">Theorem</xref>.
    You should carefully apply Theorem 6.1, as illustrated in <xref ref="Cont_Int_Ex_1">Examples</xref>

    Contour integrals have properties that are similar to those of integrals of a complex function of a real variable,

    We now give two important inequalities relating to complex integrals.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>Absolute value inequality</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(t)=u(t) +iv(t)</m><nbsp/>is a continuous function of the real parameter <m>t</m>, then
        <men xml:id="Int_Triangle_Ineq">
          \left| \int_a^b f(t)\,dt \right| \le \int_a^b \left| f(t) \right| \,dt
        </men>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>\int_a^bf(t)\,dt=0</m>,
      then Equation <xref ref="Int_Triangle_Ineq"/> is obviously true.
      If the integral is not zero,
      we write its value in polar form,
      say <m>\int_a^bf(t)\,dt=r_0e^{i\theta _0}</m>,
      so that <m>\left\vert \int_a^bf(t)\,dt\right\vert = |r_0e^{i\theta_0}|=r_0</m>,
      and <m>r_0=\int _a^be^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\,dt</m>.
      Taking the real part of both sides of this last equation gives
      <me>
        r_0=\mathrm{Re}(r_0)=\mathrm{Re}\left[ \int_a^be^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\,dt\right] =\int_a^b\mathrm{Re}\big[e^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\big]\,dt
      </me>.
      where the last equality is justified because an integral is a limit of a sum,
      and its real part is the same as the limit of the sum of its real parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, using Equation <xref ref="ReImLEMod"/>, we obtain
      <men xml:id="Integral_Ineq">
        \mathrm{Re}\big[e^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\big] \le \big|e^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\big| = |f(t)|
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that, if <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are real functions,
      with <m>g(t) \le h(t)</m>,
      for all <m>t \in [a,b]</m>, then <m>\int_a^bg(t\,dt \le \int_a^b h(t)\,dt</m>.
      Applying this fact to the left and right sides of Equation <xref ref="Integral_Ineq"/> \big(with
      <m>g(t)=\mathrm{Re}\big[e^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\big]</m> and <m>h(t)=|f(t)|</m>\big) yields
      <me>
        r_0=\int_a^b\mathrm{Re}\big[e^{-i\theta _0}f(t)\big]\,dt \le \int_a^b|f(t)|\,dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>r_0=\left| \int_a^bf(t)\,dt\right|</m>,
      this last inequality establishes our result.
