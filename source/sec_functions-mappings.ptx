    A <term>complex-valued function</term>
    <m>f</m> of the complex variable <m>z</m> is a rule that assigns to each complex number <m>z</m> in a set <m>D</m> one and only one complex number <m>w</m>.
    We write <m>w=f(z)</m> and call <m>w</m> the
    <term>image of</term><m>z</m>
    <term>under</term> <m>f</m>.
    A simple example of a complex-valued function is given by the formula <m>w=f(z)=z^2</m>.
    The set <m>D</m> is called the <term>domain</term> of <m>f</m>,
    and the set of all images <m>\{w=f(z) :z \in D \}</m> is called the
    <term>range</term> of <m>f</m>.
    When the context is obvious, we omit the phrase
    <em>complex-valued</em>,
    and simply refer to a function <m>f</m>,
    or to a complex function <m>f</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can define the domain to be any set that makes sense for a given rule,
    so for <m>w=f(z)=z^2</m>,
    we could have the entire complex plane for the domain <m>D</m>,
    or we might artificially restrict the domain to some set such as <m>D=D_1(0)=\{z:|z|\lt 1\}</m>.
    Determining the range for a function defined by a formula is not always easy,
    but we will see plenty of examples later on.
    In some contexts functions are referred to as <em>mappings</em>
    or <em>transformations</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_topology">Section</xref>,
    we used the term <em>domain</em>
    to indicate a connected open set.
    When speaking about the domain of a
    <em>function</em>, however,
    we mean only the set of points on which the function is defined.
    This distinction is worth noting,
    and context will make clear the use intended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as <m>z</m> can be expressed by its real and imaginary parts,
    <m>z=x+iy</m>, we write <m>f(z)=w=u+iv</m>,
    where <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are the real and imaginary parts of <m>w</m>,
    respectively.
    Doing so gives us the representation
    <me>
      w=f(z) =f(x, y) =f(x+iy)=u+iv
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> depend on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
    they can be considered to be real-valued functions of the real variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>; that is,
    <me>
      u=u(x, y)  \text{ and }   v=v(x, y)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Combining these ideas,
    we often write a complex function <m>f</m> in the form
    <men xml:id="f_z_">
      f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x, y)+iv(x, y)
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="fig_ch-02-01">Figure</xref>
    illustrates the notion of a function (mapping) using these symbols.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-02-01">
    <caption>The mapping <m>w=f(z)</m></caption>
    <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-02/ch-02-fig-01.pdf"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We now give several examples that illustrate how to express a complex function.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Write <m>f(z)=z^4</m> in the form <m>f(z)=u(x,y) + iv(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the binomial formula, we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>f(z)  \amp = (x+iy)^4 = x^4+4x^3iy+6x^2(iy)^2 + 4x(iy)^3 + (iy)^4</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(x^{4}-6x^2y^2+y^{4}) +i(4x^{3}y-4xy^{3})</mrow>
        </md>,
        so that <m>u(x,y) =x^4 - 6x^2 y^2 + y^4</m> and <m>v(x,y) =4x^3 y - 4xy^3</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Express the function <m>f(z) =\overline{z}\mathrm{Re}(z)+z^2 + \mathrm{Im}(z)</m> in the form <m>f(z) =u(x,y) +iv(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using the elementary properties of complex numbers, it follows that
        <me>
          f(z) =(x-iy) x+(x^2 - y^2 + i2xy) + y = (2x^2-y^2+y) + i(xy)
        </me>,
        so that <m>u(x,y) = 2x^2-y^2+y</m> and <m>v(x,y) = xy</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    Examples 2.1 and 2.2 show how to find <m>u(x,y)</m> and <m>v(x,y)</m> when a rule for computing <m>f</m> is given.
    Conversely, if <m>u(x,y)</m> and <m>v(x,y)</m> are two real-valued functions of the real variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
    they determine a complex-valued function <m>f(x,y) = u(x,y) +iv(x,y)</m>,
    and we can use the formulas
    <me>
      x=\frac{z+\overline{z}}{2}  \text{ and }  =\frac{z-\overline{z}}{2i}
    </me>
    to find a formula for <m>f</m> involving the variables <m>z</m> and <m>\overline{z}</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Express <m>f(z) =4x^2+i4y^2</m> by a formula involving the variables <m>z</m> and <m>\overline{z}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Calculation reveals that
        <md>
          <mrow>f(z)  \amp = 4\left(\frac{z+\overline{z}}{2}\right)^2+i4\left(\frac{z-\overline{z}}{2i}\right)^2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = z^2 + 2z\overline{z} + \overline{z}^2 - i(z^2 - 2z\overline{z} + \overline{z}^2)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = (1-i)z^2 + (2+2i)z\overline{z}+(1-i) \overline{z}^2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    Using <m>z=re^{i\theta}</m> in the expression of a complex function <m>f</m> may be convenient.
    It gives us the polar representation
    <men xml:id="f_z_Polar">
      f(z) = f(re^{i\theta}) =u(r,\theta) +iv(r,\theta)
    </men>,
    where <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are real functions of the real variables <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>.
  </p>
  <remark>
    <p>
      For a given function <m>f</m>,
      the functions <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> defined<nbsp/>here are different from those defined by Equation <xref ref="f_z_"/> because Equation <xref ref="f_z_"/> involves Cartesian coordinates and Equation <xref ref="f_z_Polar"/> involves polar coordinates.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Express <m>f(z) =z^2</m> in both Cartesian and polar form.
      </p>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the Cartesian form, a simple calculation gives
          <me>
            f(z) =f(x+iy) =(x+iy)^2 = (x^2-y^2) +i(2xy) =u(x,y) +iv(x,y)
          </me>
          so that
          <me>
            u(x,y) = x^2-y^2,  \text{ and }   v(x, y) = 2xy
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the polar form, we refer to Equation <xref ref="z_n"/> to get
          <me>
            f(re^{i\theta})=(re^{i\theta})^2 = r^2e^{i2\theta}=r^2\cos2\theta+ir^2\sin2\theta=U(r,\theta) + iV(r,\theta)
          </me>,
          so that
          <me>
            U(r,\theta) =r^2\cos2\theta  \text{ and }   V(r,\theta) =r^2\sin2\theta
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
      <p>
        Once we have defined <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> for a function <m>f</m> in Cartesian form,
        we must use different symbols if we want to express <m>f</m> in polar form.
        As is clear here,
        the functions <m>u</m> and <m>U</m> are quite different,
        as are <m>v</m> and <m>V</m>.
        Of course, if we are working only in one context,
        we can use any symbols we choose.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Express <m>f(z) =z^5+4z^2-6</m> in polar form.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Again, using Equation <xref ref="z_n"/> we obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>f(z)  \amp = f(re^{i\theta}) = r^5(\cos 5\theta +i\sin 5\theta) + 4r^2(\cos 2\theta +i\sin 2\theta ) - 6</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =(r^5\cos 5\theta +4r^2\cos 2\theta -6) +i(r^5\sin 5\theta +4r^2\sin 2\theta)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  =u(r,\theta) +iv(r,\theta)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    We now look at the geometric interpretation of a complex function.
    If <m>D</m> is the domain of real-valued functions <m>u(x, y)</m> and <m>v(x, y)</m>,
    the equations
    <me>
      u=u(x,y)  \text{ and }   v=v(x,y)
    </me>
    describe a transformation
    (or mapping)
    from <m>D</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane into the <m>uv</m> plane,
    also called the <m>w</m> plane.
    Therefore, we can also consider the function
    <me>
      w= f(z) = u(x,y) +iv(x,y)
    </me>
    to be a transformation
    (or mapping)
    from the set <m>D</m> in the <m>z</m> plane onto the range <m>R</m> in the <m>w</m> plane.
    This idea was illustrated in Figure 2.1.
    In the following paragraphs we present some additional key ideas.
    They are staples for any kind of function,
    and you should memorize all the terms in bold.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>A</m> is a subset of the domain <m>D</m> of <m>f</m>,
    the set <m>B=\{f(z) : z \in A\}</m> is called the
    <term>image</term> of the set <m>A</m>,
    and <m>f</m> is said to map<nbsp/><m>A</m>
    <term>onto</term> <m>B</m>.
    The image of a single point is a single point,
    and the image of the entire domain,
    <m>D</m>, is the range, <m>R</m>.
    The mapping <m>w=f(z)</m> is said to be from <m>A</m> <term>into</term>
    <m>S</m> if the image of <m>A</m> is contained in <m>S</m>.
    Mathematicians use the notation
    <m>f:A\longmapsto S</m> to indicate that a function maps <m>A</m> into <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="fig_ch-02-02">Figure</xref>
    illustrates a function <m>f</m> whose domain is <m>D</m> and whose range is <m>R</m>.
    The shaded areas depict that the function maps <m>A</m> <em>onto</em> <m>B</m>.
    The function also maps <m>A</m>
    <em>into</em> <m>R</m>, and,
    of course, it maps <m>D</m> <em>onto</em> <m>R</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-02-02">
    <caption><m>f</m> maps <m>A</m> <em>onto</em> <m>B</m>; <m>f</m> maps <m>A</m> <em>into</em> <m>R</m></caption>

  <p>
    The <term>inverse image</term> of a point <m>w</m> is the set of all points <m>z</m> in <m>D</m> such that <m>w=f(z)</m>.
    The inverse image of a point may be one point,
    several points, or nothing at all.
    If the last case occurs then the point <m>w</m> is not in the range of <m>f</m>.
    For example, if <m>w=f(z) =iz</m>,
    the inverse image of the point <m>-1</m> is the single point <m>i</m>,
    because <m>f(i)=i(i)=-1</m>,
    and <m>i</m> is the <em>only</em>
    point that maps to <m>-1</m>.
    In the case of <m>w=f(z) =z^2</m>,
    the inverse image of the point <m>-1</m> is the set <m>\{i,-i\}</m>.
    You will learn in <xref ref="ch_elementary-fcns"/> that,
    if <m>w=f(z)=e^z</m>,
    the inverse image of the point <m>0</m> is the empty set<mdash/>there is no complex number <m>z</m> such that <m>e^z=0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inverse image of a set of points, <m>S</m>,
    is the collection of all points in the domain that map into <m>S</m>.
    If <m>f</m> maps <m>D</m> onto <m>R</m> it is possible for the inverse image of <m>R</m> to be function as well,
    but the original function must have a special property:
    a function <m>f</m> is said to be <term>one-to-one</term>
    if it maps distinct points
    <m>z_1 \ne z_2</m> onto distinct points <m>f(z_1) \ne f(z_2)</m>.
    Many times an easy way to prove that a function <m>f</m> is one-to-one is to suppose <m>f(z_1)=f(z_2)</m>,
    and from this assumption deduce that <m>z_1</m> must equal <m>z_2</m>.
    Thus, <m>f(z)=iz</m> is one-to-one because if
    <m>f(z_1)=f(z_2)</m>, then <m>iz_1=iz_2</m>.
    Dividing both sides of the last equation by <m>i</m> gives <m>z_1=z_2</m>.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-02-03">Figure</xref>
    2.3 illustrates the idea of a one-to-one function:
    distinct points get mapped to distinct points.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-02-03">
    <caption>A one-to-one function</caption>
    <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-02/ch-02-fig-03.pdf"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The function <m>f(z) =z^2</m> <em>is not</em>
    one-to-one because <m>-i \ne i</m>, but <m>f(i)=f(-i)=-1</m>.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-02-04">Figure</xref> depicts this situation:
    at least two different points get mapped to the same point.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-02-04">

  <p>
    In the exercises we ask you to demonstrate that one-to-one functions give rise to inverses that are functions.
    Loosely speaking,
    if <m>w=f(z)</m> maps the set <m>A</m> one-to-one and onto the set <m>B</m>,
    then for each <m>w</m> in <m>B</m> there exists exactly one point <m>z</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>w=f(z)</m>.
    For any such value of <m>z</m> we can take the equation <m>w=f(z)</m> and
    <q>solve</q>
    for <m>z</m> as a function of <m>w</m>.
    Doing so produces an inverse function <m>z=g(w)</m> where the following equations hold:
    <md>
      <mrow>g\big(f(z)\big) \amp =z  \text{ for all }   z\in A  \text{ and }</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="InverseEqs" number="yes">f\big(g(w)\big) \amp =w  \text{ for all }   w \in B</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, if <m>w=f(z)</m> and <m>z=g(w)</m> are functions that map <m>A</m> into <m>B</m> and <m>B</m> into <m>A</m>,
    respectively, and Equations <xref ref="InverseEqs"/> hold,
    then <m>f</m> maps the set <m>A</m> one-to-one and onto the set <m>B</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, if <m>f</m> is a one-to-one mapping from <m>D</m> onto <m>T</m> and if <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>D</m>,
    then <m>f</m> is a one-to-one mapping from <m>A</m> onto its image <m>B</m>.
    We can also show that,
    if <m>\zeta=f(z)</m> is a one-to-one mapping from <m>A</m> onto <m>B</m> and
    <m>w=g(\zeta)</m> is a one-to-one mapping from <m>B</m> onto <m>S</m>,
    then the composite mapping
    <m>w=g\big(f(z)\big)</m> is a one-to-one mapping from <m>A</m> onto <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We usually indicate the inverse of <m>f</m> by the symbol <m>f^{-1}</m>.
    If the domains of <m>f</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m> are <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
    respectively,
    we can rewrite Equations <xref ref="InverseEqs"/> as
    <md>
      <mrow>f^{-1}\big(f(z)\big) \amp =z  \text{ for all }   z \in A  \text{ and }</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="InverseEqs3" number="yes">f\big(f^{-1}(w)\big) \amp = w \text{ for all }   w \in B</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, for <m>z_0 \in B</m> and <m>w_0 \in A</m>,
    <men xml:id="InverseEqs2">
      w_0=f(z_0)  \text{ iff }   f^{-1}(w_0)=z_0  \text{ and }   z_0=f^{-1}(w_0)  \text{ iff }  f(z_0) =w_0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="Inverse_Ex">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>w=</m> <m>f(z)=iz</m> for any complex number <m>z</m>,

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can easily show <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto the entire complex plane.
        We solve for <m>z</m>, given <m>w=f(z)=iz</m>,
        to get <m>z=\frac{w}{i}=-iw</m>.
        By Equations <xref ref="InverseEqs2"/>,
        this result implies that <m>f^{-1}(w)=-iw</m> for all complex numbers <m>w</m>.

  <remark xml:id="InverseRmk">
    <p>
      Once we have specified <m>f^{-1}(w)=-iw</m> for all complex numbers <m>w</m>,

      We could just as easily write

    We now show how to find the image <m>B</m> of a specified set <m>A</m> under a given mapping <m>u+iv=w=f(z)</m>.
    The set <m>A</m> is usually described with an equation or inequality involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
    Using inverse functions,
    we can construct a chain of equivalent statements leading to a description of the set <m>B</m> in terms of an equation or an inequality involving <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.

        Note what this result says: <m>u+iv=w \in B \Longleftrightarrow v=-u-1</m>.
        The image of <m>A</m> under <m>f</m>, therefore,
        is the set <m>B=\{(u,v):v=-u-1\}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Method 2): We write <m>u+iv=w=f(z) =i(x+iy)=-y+ix</m> and note that the transformation can be given by the equations <m>u=-y</m> and <m>v=x</m>.
        Because <m>A</m> is described by <m>A=\{x+iy:y=x+1\}</m>,
        we can substitute <m>u=-y</m> and <m>v=x</m> into the equation <m>y=x+1</m> to obtain <m>-u=v+1</m>,
        which we can rewrite as <m>v=-u-1</m>.
        If you use this method,
        be sure to pay careful attention to domains and ranges.

    We now look at some elementary mappings.
    If we let <m>B=a+ib</m> denote a fixed complex constant,
    the transformation
    <me>
      w = T(z) = z+B = x+a+i(y+b)
    </me>
    is a one-to-one mapping of the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane and is called a <term>translation</term>.
    This transformation can be visualized as a rigid translation whereby the point <m>z</m> is displaced through the vector <m>B=a+ib</m> to its new position <m>w=T(z)</m>.
    The inverse mapping is given by
    <me>
      z = T^{-1}(w) = w-B = u-a+i(v-b)
    </me>
    and shows that <m>T</m> is a one-to-one mapping from the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane.
    The effect of a translation is depicted in <xref ref="fig_ch-02-05">Figure</xref>.

  <p>
    If we let <m>\alpha</m> be a fixed real number,
    then for <m>z=re^{i\theta}</m>, the transformation
    <me>
      w=R(z) = ze^{i\alpha} = re^{i\theta}e^{i\alpha} = re^{i(\theta +\alpha)}
    </me>
    is a one-to-one mapping of the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane and is called a <term>rotation</term>.
    It can be visualized as a rigid rotation whereby the point <m>z</m> is rotated about the origin through an angle <m>\alpha</m> to its new position <m>w=R(z)</m>.
    If we use polar coordinates and designate
    <m>w=\rho ^{i\phi}</m> in the <m>w</m> plane,
    then the inverse mapping is
    <me>
      z = R^{-1}(w) = we^{-i\alpha} = \rho e^{i\phi}e^{-i\alpha} = \rho e^{i(\phi -\alpha)}

        The ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal major axis of four units and vertical minor axis of two units can be represented by the parametric equation
        <me>
          s(t)=2\cos t+i\sin t=(2\cos t,\,\sin t)  \text{ for }  0 \le  t\le  2\pi

      <p>
        Suppose that we wanted to rotate the ellipse by an angle of <m>\pi /6</m> radians and shift the center of the ellipse 2 units to the right and 1 unit up.
        Using complex arithmetic,
        we can easily generate a parametric equation <m>r(t)</m> that does so:

    If we let <m>K>0</m> be a fixed positive real number, then the transformation
    <me>
      w=S(z) =Kz=Kx+iKy
    </me>
    is a one-to-one mapping of the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane and is called a
    <term>magnification</term>.
    If <m>K>1</m>,
    it has the effect of stretching the distance between points by the factor <m>K</m>.
    If <m>K\lt 1</m>,
    then it reduces the distance between points by the factor <m>K</m>.
    The inverse transformation is given by
    <me>
      z=S^{-1}(w) =\frac{1}{K}w=\frac{1}{K}u+i\frac{1}{K}v
    </me>
    and shows that <m>S</m> is one-to-one mapping from the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane.

    Finally, if we let <m>A=Ke^{i\alpha}</m> and <m>B=a+ib</m>,
    where <m>K>0</m> is a positive real number, then the transformation
    <me>
      w = L(z) = Az+B
    </me>
    is a one-to-one mapping of the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane and is called a linear transformation.
    It can be considered as the composition of a rotation,
    a magnification, and a translation.
    It has the effect of rotating the plane through an angle given by <m>\alpha =\mathrm{Arg}(A)</m>,
    followed by a magnification by the factor <m>K=|A|</m>,
    followed by a translation by the vector <m>B=a+ib</m>.
    The inverse mapping is given by
    <m>z=L^{-1}(w) =\frac{1}{A}w-\frac{B}{A}</m> and shows that <m>L</m> is a one-to-one mapping from the <m>z</m> plane onto the <m>w</m> plane.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that the linear transformation <m>w=iz+i</m> maps the right half-plane
        <m>\mathrm{Re}(z) \ge 1</m> onto the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) \ge 2</m>.
      </p>
      <solution>
        <p>
          (Method 1): Let <m>A=\{(x,y) : x \ge  1\}</m>.
          To describe <m>B=f(A)</m>,
          we solve <m>w=iz+i</m> for <m>z</m> to get <m>z=\frac{w-i}{i}=-iw-1=f^{-1}(w)</m>.
          Using Equations <xref ref="InverseEqs2"/> and the method of <xref ref="ImageEx">Example</xref> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>u+iv=w=f(z) \in B  \amp  \Longleftrightarrow f^{-1}(w) = z \in A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \Longleftrightarrow -iw-1 \in A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \Longleftrightarrow v-1-iu \in A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \Longleftrightarrow (v-1,\,-u) \in A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  \Longleftrightarrow v-1 \ge  1</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>
      </solution>
      <p>
        Thus <m>B = \{w=u+iv : v \ge 2\}</m>,
        which is the same as saying <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) \ge 2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Method 2): When we write <m>w=f(z)</m> in Cartesian form as
        <me>
          w=u+iv=i(x+iy) +i=-y+i(x+1)
        </me>,
        we see that the transformation can be given by the equations <m>u=-y</m> and <m>v=x+1</m>.
        Substituting <m>x=v-1</m> in the inequality
        <m>\mathrm{Re}(z) = x \ge  1</m> gives <m>v-1 \ge  1</m>,
        or <m>v \ge  2</m>,
        which is the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) \ge  2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Method 3): The effect of the transformation <m>w=f(z)</m> is a rotation of the plane through the angle <m>\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>
        (when <m>z</m> is multiplied by <m>i</m>)
        followed by a translation by the vector <m>B=i</m>.
        The first operation yields the set <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) \ge 1</m>.
        The second shifts this set up 1 unit,
        resulting in the set <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) \ge 2</m>.

        We illustrate this result in <xref ref="fig_ch-02-09">Figure</xref>.

  <p>
    Translations and rotations preserve angles.
    First, magnifications rescale distance by a factor <m>K</m>,
    so it follows that triangles are mapped onto similar triangles,
    preserving angles.
    Then, because a linear transformation can be considered to be a composition of a rotation,
    a magnification,
    and a translation,
    it follows that linear transformations preserve angles.
    Consequently,
    any geometric object is mapped onto an object that is similar to the original object;
    hence linear transformations can be called
    <term>similarity mappings</term>.
