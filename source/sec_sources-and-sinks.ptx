    <p>
      If the two-dimensional motion of an ideal fluid consists of an outward radial flow from a point and is symmetrical in all directions,
      then the point is called a <em>simple source</em>.
      A source at the origin can be considered as a line perpendicular to the <m>z</m> plane along which fluid is being emitted.
      If the rate of emission of volume of fluid per unit length is 2<m>\pi m</m>,
      then the origin is said to be a source of strength <m>m</m>,
      the complex potential for the flow is
      <me>
        F(z) = m\log z
      </me>,
      and the velocity <m>\mathbf{V}</m> at the point <m>(x,y)</m> is given by
      <me>
        \mathbf{V}(x,y) = \overline{F,'(z)} = \frac{m}{\bar{z}}
      </me>.
      For fluid flows,
      a sink is a negative source and is a point of inward radial flow at which the fluid is considered to be absorbed or annihilated.

    <title>Source: A Charged Line</title>
    <p>
      In the case of electrostatics,
      a source will correspond to a uniformly charged line perpendicular to the <m>z</m> plane at the point <m>z_0</m>.
      We will show that if the line <m>L</m> is located at <m>z_0=0</m> and carries a charge density of
      <m>\frac{q}{2}</m> coulombs per unit length,
      then the magnitude of the electrical field is <m>|\mathbf{E}(x,y)| = \frac{q}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}</m>.
      Hence, <m>\mathbf{E}</m> is given by
      <men xml:id="electfield">
        \mathbf{E}(x,y) = \frac{qz}{|z|^2}=\frac{q}{\bar{z}}
      </men>,
      and the complex potential is
      <me>
        F(z) = -q\log z,  \text{ and }   \mathbf{E}(x,y) = -\overline{F,'(z)}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sink for electrostatics is a negatively charged line perpendicular to the <m>z</m> plane.
      The electric field for electrostatic problems corresponds to the velocity field for fluid flow problems,
      except that their corresponding potentials differ by a sign change.
    </p>
    <p>
      To establish Equation <xref ref="electfield"/>,
      we start with Coulomb's law,
      which states that two particles with charges <m>q</m> and <m>Q</m> exert a force on one another with magnitude <m>\frac{CqQ}{r^2}</m>,
      where <m>r</m> is the distance between particles and <m>C</m> is a constant that depends on the scientific units.
      For simplicity,
      we assume that <m>C=1</m> and the test particle at the point <m>z</m> has charge <m>Q=1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contribution <m>\Delta \mathbf{E}_1</m> induced by the element of charge
      <m>\frac{q\Delta h}{2}</m> along the segment of length
      <m>\Delta h</m> situated at a height <m>h</m> above the plane has magnitude <m>|\Delta \mathbf{E} _1|</m> given by
      <me>
        |\Delta \mathbf{E}_1| = \frac{(\frac{q}{2})\Delta h}{r^2+h^2}
      </me>.
      It has the same magnitude as
      <m>\Delta \mathbf{E}_2</m> induced by the element
      <m>\frac{q\Delta h}{2}</m> located a distance <m>-h</m> below the plane.
      From the vertical symmetry involved their sum,
      <m>\Delta \mathbf{E}_2+\Delta \mathbf{E}_2</m>,
      lies parallel to the plane along the ray from the origin,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-094">Figure</xref>.

    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-094">
      <caption>Contributions to <m>\mathbf{E}</m> from the elements of charge <m>\frac{q\Delta h}{2}</m> situated at <m>(0,0,\pm h)</m>, above and

    <p>
      By the principal of superposition,
      we add all contributions from the elements of charge along <m>L</m> to obtain <m>\mathbf{E}=\sum\Delta \mathbf{E}_k</m>.
      By vertical symmetry,
      <m>\mathbf{E}</m> lies parallel to the complex plane along the ray from the origin through the point <m>z</m>.
      Hence the magnitude of <m>\mathbf{E}</m> is the sum of all components
      <m>|\Delta \mathbf{E}|\cos t</m> that are parallel to the complex plane,
      where <m>t</m> is the angle between <m>\Delta \mathbf{E}</m> and the plane.
      Letting <m>\Delta h\to 0</m> in this summation process produces the definite integral
      <me>
        |\mathbf{E}(x,y)| =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\Delta \mathbf{E}|\cos t\,dh = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(\frac{q}{2}) \cos t}{r^2+h^2}\,dh
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we use the change of variable <m>h=r\tan t</m> and
      <m>dh=r\sec^2t\,dt</m> and the trigonometric identity
      <m>\sec ^2t=\frac{r^2+h^2}{r^2}</m> to obtain the equivalent integral:
      <me>
        |\mathbf{E}(x,y)| =\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(\frac{q}{2}) \cos t}{r^2+h^2}\frac{r^2+h^2}{r}\,dt = \frac{q}{2r}\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2}\cos t\,dt=\frac{q}{r}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiplying this magnitude <m>\frac{q}{r}</m> by the unit vector
      <m>\frac{z}{|z|}</m> establishes Formula <xref ref="electfield"/>.
      If <m>q>0</m>,
      then the field is directed away from <m>z_0=0</m> and,
      if <m>q\lt 0</m>, then it is directed toward <m>z_0=0</m>.
      An electrical field located at <m>z_0 \ne 0</m> is given by
      <me>
        E(x,y) = \frac{q(z-z_0)}{|z-z_0|^2}=\frac{q}{\overline{z}-\overline{z_0}}

      <title>Source and sink of equal strength</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let a source and sink of unit strength be located at the points <m>+1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
          respectively.
          The complex potential for a fluid flowing from the source at <m>+1</m> to the sink at <m>-1</m> is
          <me>
            F(z) = \log(z-1) - \log(z+1) = \log\left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)

          The velocity potential and stream function are, respectively
          <me>
            \phi(x,y) = \ln \left| \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right|  \text{ and }   \psi(x,y) = \arg\left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)
          </me>.
          To solve for the streamline <m>\psi(x,y)=c</m> we start with
          <me>
            c = \arg\left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right) = \arg\left(\frac{x^2+y^2-1+i2y}{(x+1)^2+y^2}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2-1}\right)
          </me>,
          and obtain the equation <m>(\tan c)(x^2+y^2-1)=2y</m>.
          A straightforward calculation shows that points on the streamline must satisfy the equation

            x^2+(y-\cot c)^2=1+\cot ^2c

            c = \arg(z^2-1) = \arg(x^2-y^2-1+i2xy) = \arctan\left(\frac{2xy}{x^2-y^2-1}\right)
          </me>,
          and obtain the equation <m>x^2+2xy\cot c-y^2=1</m>.
          If we express this equation in the form
          <md>
            <mrow>\left(x-y\tan \frac{c}{2}\right)\left(x+y\cot \frac{c}{2}\right) \amp = 1,  \text{ or }</mrow>

          </md>,
          and use the rotation of axes
          <me>
            x^* = x\cos\left(-\frac{c}{2}\right) + y\sin\left(-\frac{c}{2}\right),  \text{ and } y^* = -x\sin\left(-\frac{c}{2}\right) + y\cos\left(-\frac{c}{2}\right)
          </me>,
          then the streamlines must satisfy the equation

    <p>
      Let an ideal fluid flow in a domain in the <m>z</m> plane be effected by a source located at the point <m>z_0</m>.
      Then the flow at points <m>z</m>,
      which lie in a small neighborhood of the point <m>z_0</m>,
      is approximated by that of a source with the complex potential
      <me>
        \log(z-z_0) + \text{ constant. }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>w=S(z)</m> is a conformal mapping and <m>w_0=S(z_0)</m>,
      then <m>S(z)</m> has a nonzero derivative at <m>z_0</m>, and
      <me>
        w-w_0=(z-z_0)[ S\,'(z_0) +\eta(z)]

      where <m>\eta(z) \to 0</m> as <m>z \to z_0</m>.
      Taking logarithms yields

        \log(w-w_0) = \log(z-z_0) + \mathrm{Log}[S\,'(z_0) + \eta (z)]

      the term <m>\mathrm{Log}[S\,'(z_0) + \eta(z)]</m> approaches the constant value <m>\mathrm{Log}[S\,'(z_0)]</m> as <m>z \to z_0</m>.
      Also, because <m>\log (z-z_0)</m> is the complex potential for a source located at the point <m>z_0</m>,
      the image of a source under a conformal mapping is a source.

    <p>
      We can use the technique of conformal mapping to determine the fluid flow in a domain <m>D</m> in the <m>z</m> plane that is produced by sources and sinks.

          which lie along streamlines of the flow.
