  <title>Harmonic Functions</title>
  <p>
    Let <m>\phi (x,y)</m> be a real-valued function of the two real variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> defined on a domain <m>D</m>.
    (Recall that a domain is a connected open set.)
    The partial differential equation
    <men xml:id="Laplace_s_Equation">
      \phi _{xx}(x,y) +\phi _{yy}(x,y) = 0
    </men>
    is known as <em>Laplace's equation</em>
    (sometimes referred to as the potential equation).
    If <m>\phi, \, \phi _x, \, \phi_y, \, \phi _{xx}, \, \phi _{xy}, \, \phi _{yx}</m>,
    and <m>\phi _{yy}</m> are all continuous,
    and if <m>\phi (x,y)</m> satisfies Laplace's equation,
    then <m>\phi(x,y)</m> is harmonic on <m>D</m>.
    Harmonic functions are important in applied mathematics,
    engineering, and mathematical physics.
    They are used to solve problems involving steady state temperatures,
    two-dimensional electrostatics, and ideal fluid flow.
    In <xref ref="ch_harmonic-apps">Chapter</xref>
    we describe how complex analysis techniques can be used to solve some problems involving harmonic functions.
    We begin with an important theorem relating analytic and harmonic functions.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Harmonic_Theorem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <em>Let</em><m>f(z) = u(x,y) +iv(x,y)</m> be an analytic function on a domain <m>D</m>.
        Then both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are harmonic functions on <m>D</m>.
        In other words,
        the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      In Corollary 6.3 we will show that,
      if <m>f(z)</m> is analytic,
      then all partial derivatives of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are continuous.
      Using that result here, we see that,
      as <m>f</m> is analytic,
      <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
      <me>
        u_x = v_y  \text{ and }   u_y = -v_x
      </me>.
      Taking the partial derivative with respect to <m>x</m> of each side of these equations gives
      <me>
        u_{xx} = v_{yx}  \text{ and }   u_{yx} = -v_{xx}
      </me>.
      Similarly, taking the partial derivative of each side with respect to <m>y</m> yields
      <me>
        u_{xy}=v_{yy}  \text{ and }   u_{yy} = -v_{xy}
      </me>.
      The partial derivatives <m>u_{xy}</m>,
      <m>u_{yx}</m>, <m>v_{xy}</m>,
      and <m>v_{yx}</m> are all continuous,
      so we use a theorem from the calculus of real functions that states that the mixed partial derivatives are equal; that is,
      <me>
        u_{xy}=u_{yx}  \text{ and }   v_{xy}=v_{yx}
      </me>.
      Combining all these results finally gives <m>u_{xx}+u_{yy}=v_{yx}-v_{xy}=0</m>,
      and <m>v_{xx}+v_{yy}=-u_{yx}+u_{xy}=0</m>.
      Therefore both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are harmonic functions on <m>D</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    If we have a function <m>u(x,y)</m> that is harmonic on the domain <m>D</m> and if we can find another harmonic function <m>v(x,y)</m> such that the partial derivatives for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations throughout <m>D</m>,
    then we say that <m>v(x,y)</m> is a harmonic conjugate of <m>u(x,y)</m>.
    It then follows that the function
    <m>f(z) =u(x,y) + iv(x,y)</m> is analytic on <m>D</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>u(x,y) =x^2-y^2</m>, then <m>u_{xx}(x ,y) + u_{yy}(x,y) = 2-2 = 0</m>;
        hence <m>u</m> is a harmonic function for all <m>z</m>.
        We find that <m>v(x,y) = 2xy</m> is also a harmonic function and that
        <me>
          u_x=v_y=2x  \text{ and }   u_y=-v_x=-2y
        </me>.
        Therefore <m>v</m> is a harmonic conjugate of <m>u</m>,
        and the function <m>f</m> given by
        <me>
          f(z) =x^2-y^2+i2xy=z^2
        </me>
        is an analytic function.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <xref ref="Harmonic_Theorem">Theorem</xref>
    makes the construction of harmonic functions from known analytic functions an easy task.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(z)=z^3=x^3-3xy^2+i(3x^2y-y^3)</m> is analytic for all values of <m>z</m>.
        Hence it follows that
        <me>
          u(x,y) = \mathrm{Re}\left[ f(z) \right] =x^3-3xy^2
        </me>
        is harmonic for all <m>z</m>, and that
        <me>
          v(x,y) = \mathrm{Im}\left[ f(z) \right] =3x^2y-y^3
        </me>
        is a harmonic conjugate of <m>u(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <xref ref="fig_ch-03-02">Figures</xref>
    and <xref ref="fig_ch-03-03"></xref>
    show the graphs of these two functions.
    The partial derivatives are <m>u_x(x,y)=3x^2-3y^2, \, u_y(x,y)=-6xy, \, v_x(x,y)=6xy</m>,
    and <m>v_y(x,y)=3x^2-3y^2</m>.
    They satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations because they are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function.
    At the point <m>(x,y) =(2,-1)</m>,
    we have <m>u_x(2,-1)=v_y(2,-1) =9</m>,
    and these partial derivatives appear along the edges of the surfaces for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> where <m>x=2</m> and <m>y=-1</m>.
    Similarly, <m>u_y(2,-1) =12</m> and
    <m>v_x(2,-1) =-12</m> also appear along the edges of the surfaces for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> where <m>x=2</m> and <m>y=-1</m>.

    We can use complex analysis to show easily that certain combinations of harmonic functions are harmonic.
    For example, if <m>v</m> is a harmonic conjugate of <m>u</m>,
    then their product <m>\phi(x,y)=u(x,y)v(x,y)</m> is a harmonic function.
    This condition can be verified directly by computing the partial derivatives and showing that Equation <xref ref="Laplace_s_Equation"/> holds,
    but the details are tedious.
    If we use complex variable techniques instead,
    we can start with the fact that
    <m>f(z)=u(x,y) + iv(x,y)</m> is an analytic function.
    Then we observe that the square of <m>f</m> is also an analytic function:
    <me>
      [f(z)]^2 = [u(x,y)]^2-[v(x,y)]^2 + i2u(x,y) v(x,y)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We then know immediately that the imaginary part, <m>2u(x,y) v(x,y)</m>,
    is a harmonic function by <xref ref="Harmonic_Theorem">Theorem</xref>.
    A constant multiple of a harmonic function is harmonic,
    so it follows that <m>\phi</m> is harmonic.
    We leave as an exercise to show that,
    if <m>u_1</m> and <m>u_2</m> are two harmonic functions that are not related in the preceding fashion,
    then their product need not be harmonic.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Conjugate_Construction">
    <title>Construction of a harmonic conjugate</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u(x,y)</m> be harmonic in an
        <m>\varepsilon</m>-neighborhood of the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
        Then there exists a conjugate harmonic function <m>v(x,y)</m> defined in this neighborhood such that
        <m>f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)</m> is an analytic function.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      A conjugate harmonic function <m>v</m> will satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations <m>u_x=v_y</m> and <m>u_y=-v_x</m>.
      Assuming that such a function exists,
      we determine what it would have to look like by using a two-step process.
      First, we integrate <m>v_y</m>
      (which should equal <m>u_x</m>)
      with respect to <m>y</m> and get
      <men xml:id="v___int_ux_">
        v(x,y) = \int u_x(x,y)\,dy + C(x)
      </men>.
      where <m>C(x)</m> is a function of <m>x</m> alone that is yet to be determined.
      Second, we compute <m>C'(x)</m> by differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to <m>x</m> and replacing <m>v_x</m> with <m>-u_y</m> on the left side,
      which gives
      <me>
        -u_y(x,y) = \frac{d}{dx}\int u_x(x,y)\,dy+C\,'(x)
      </me>.
      It can be shown
      (we omit the details)
      that because <m>u</m> is harmonic,
      all terms except those involving <m>x</m> in the last equation will cancel,
      revealing a formula for <m>C\,'(x)</m> involving <m>x</m> alone.
      Elementary integration of the single-variable function <m>C\,'(x)</m> can then be used to discover <m>C(x)</m>.
      We finally observe that the function <m>v</m> so created indeed has the properties we seek.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Technically we should always specify the domain of function when defining it.
    When no such specification is given,
    it is assumed that the domain is the entire complex plane,
    or the largest set for which the expression defining the function makes sense.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>u(x,y) =xy^3-x^3y</m> is a harmonic function and find a conjugate harmonic function <m>v(x,y)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We follow the construction process of <xref ref="Conjugate_Construction">Theorem</xref>.
        The first partial derivatives are
        <men xml:id="Example_ux_Eq">
          u_x(x,y) =y^3-3x^2y  \text{ and }   u_y(x,y) =3xy^2-x^3
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To verify that <m>u</m> is harmonic,
        we compute the second partial derivatives and note that <m>u_{xx}(x,y)+u_{yy}(x,y)=-6xy+6xy=0</m>,
        so <m>u</m> satisfies Laplace's Equation <xref ref="Laplace_s_Equation"/>.
        To construct <m>v</m>,
        we start with Equation <xref ref="v___int_ux_"/> and the first of Equations <xref ref="Example_ux_Eq"/> to get
        <me>
          v(x,y) = \int (y^3-3x^2y)\,dy+C(x) = \frac{1}{4}y^4-\frac{3}{2}x^2y^2+C(x)
        </me>.
        Differentiating the left and right sides of this equation with respect to <m>x</m> and using
        <m>-u_y(x,y)=v_x(x,y)</m> and Equations <xref ref="Example_ux_Eq"/> on the left side yields
        <me>
          -3xy^2+x^3=0-3xy^2+C\,'(x)
        </me>.
        which implies that
        <me>
          C'(x) =x^3
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, if we integrate this equation we get
        <me>
          v(x,y) = \frac{1}{4}x^4-\frac{3}{2}x^2y^2+\frac{1}{4}y^4+C
        </me>
      </p>

    Harmonic functions arise as solutions to many physical problems.
    Applications include two-dimensional models of heat flow,
    electrostatics, and fluid flow.
    We now give an example of the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    We assume that an incompressible and frictionless fluid flows over the complex plane and that all cross sections in planes parallel to the complex plane are the same.
    Situations such as this occur when fluid is flowing in a deep channel.
    The velocity vector at the point <m>(x, y)</m> is
    <men xml:id="Flow">
      \mathbf{V}(x,y) =p(x,y) +iq(x,y)
    </men>,
    which we illustrate in <xref ref="fig_ch-03-04">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-03-04">
    <caption>The vector field <m>\mathbf{V}(x,y)=p(x,y)+iq(x,y)</m>, which can be considered as a fluid flow</caption>
    <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-03/ch-03-fig-04.svg"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The assumption that the flow is irrotational and has no sources or sinks implies that both the curl and divergence vanish;
    that is, <m>q_x-p_y=0</m> and <m>p_x+q_y=0</m>.
    Hence <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> obey the equations
    <men xml:id="pqCR_clone">
      p_x(x,y) =-q_y(x,y)  \text{ and }   p_y(x,y) =q_x(x,y)
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Equations <xref ref="pqCR_clone"/> are similar to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and permit us to define a special complex function:
    <men xml:id="rotational_f">
      f(z) =u(x,y) +iv(x,y) =p(x,y) - iq(x,y)
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we have <m>u_x=p_x, \, u_y=p_y, \, v_x=-q_x</m>, and <m>v_y=-q_y</m>.
    We can use Equations <xref ref="pqCR_clone"/> to verify that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for <m>f</m>:
    <md>
      <mrow>u_x(x,y) \amp  =p_x(x,y) =-q_y(x,y) = v_y(x,y)  \text{ and }</mrow>
      <mrow>u_y(x,y) \amp  =p_y(x,y) =q_x(x,y) = -v_x(x,y)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming that the functions <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have continuous partials,
    <xref ref="Sufficient_Conditions">Theorem</xref>
    guarantees that function <m>f</m> defined in Equation <xref ref="rotational_f"/> is analytic and that the fluid flow of Equation <xref ref="Flow"/> is the conjugate of an analytic function; that is,
    <me>
      \mathbf{V}(x,y) = \overline{f(z)}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="ch_complex-integration"/> we prove that every analytic function <m>f</m> has an analytic antiderivative <m>F</m>;
    assuming this to be the case, we can write
    <men xml:id="Fprime_f">
      F(z) = \phi (x,y) + i\psi(x,y)

    where <m>F\,'(z) = f(z)</m>.

  <p>
    <xref ref="Harmonic_Theorem">Theorem</xref>

      \text{ grad } \phi (x,y) = \phi _x(x,y) +i\phi_y(x,y)

  </p>
  <p>
    The Cauchy-Riemann equations applied to <m>F(z)</m> give <m>\phi_y(x,y) =-\psi_x(x,y)</m>.

  <p>
    Equation <xref ref="C-R_EQ_x"/> says that <m>\phi_x(x,y) +i\psi_x(x,y) =F\,'(z)</m>,
    which by the preceding equation and Equation <xref ref="Fprime_f"/> implies that

      \text{ grad } \phi(x,y) = \overline{F\,'(z)} = \overline{f(z)}
    </me>
