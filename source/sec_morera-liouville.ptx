  <title>The Theorems of Morera and Liouville</title>
  <p>
    In this section we investigate some of the qualitative properties of analytic and harmonic functions.
    Our first result shows that the existence of an antiderivative for a continuous function is equivalent to the statement that the integral of <m>f</m> is independent of the path of integration.
    This result is stated in a form that will serve as a converse of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Morera_s_Thm">
    <title>Morera's theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function in a simply connected domain <m>D</m>.
        If <m>\int_Cf(z)\,dz=0</m> for every closed contour <m>C</m> in <m>D</m>,
        then <m>f</m> is analytic in <m>D</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We select a point <m>z_0</m> in <m>D</m> and define <m>F(z)</m> by
      <me>
        F(z) = \int_{z_0}^{z}f(\xi)\,d\xi
      </me>,
      where the notation indicates the integral is taken on <em>any</em>
      contour that begins at <m>z_0</m> and ends at <m>z</m>.
      The function <m>F(z)</m> is well defined because,
      if <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are two contours in <m>D</m><mdash/>both with initial point <m>z_0</m> and terminal point <m>z</m>,
      then <m>C=C_1-C_2</m> is a closed contour in <m>D</m>,
      and by hypothesis,
      <me>
        0 = \int_C f(\xi)\,d\xi =\int_{C_1}f(\xi)\,d\xi - \int_{C_2} f(\xi)\,d\xi
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>f</m> is continuous,
      we know that for any <m>\varepsilon>0</m> there exists <m>\delta>0</m> such that
      <m>|f(\xi)-f(z)|\lt \varepsilon</m> whenever <m>|\xi -z| \lt \delta</m>.
      Now we can use the same steps as those in the proof of <xref ref="Antideriv_Thm">Theorem</xref>
      to show that <m>F\,'(z) = f(z)</m>.
      Hence <m>F(z)</m> is analytic on <m>D</m>,
      and <xref ref="All_derivs">Corollary</xref>
      implies that <m>F\,'(z)</m> and <m>F\,''(z)</m> are also analytic.
      Therefore <m>f\,'(z) = F\,''(z)</m> exists for all <m>z</m> in <m>D</m>,
      proving that <m>f(z)</m> is analytic in <m>D</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Cauchy<nbsp/>'s integral formula shows how the value <m>f(z_0)</m> can be represented by a contour integral.
    If we choose the contour of integration <m>C</m> to be a circle with center <m>z_0</m>,
    then we can show that the value <m>f(z_0)</m> is the integral average of the values of <m>f(z)</m> at points <m>z</m> on the circle <m>C</m>,
    a fact that the following theorem elucidates.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Gauss_s_MVT">
    <title>Gauss's mean value theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is analytic in a simply connected domain <m>D</m> that contains the circle <m>C_R(z_0)=\{z:|z-z_0|=R\}</m>, then
        <me>
          f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(z_0+Re^{i\theta})\,d\theta
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We parametrize the circle <m>C_R(z_0)</m> by
      <me>
        C_R(z_0) : z(\theta ) = z_0+Re^{i\theta},  \text{ and }   dz = iRe^{i\theta}\,d\theta,  \text{ for }  \quad0 \le \theta  \le 2\pi
      </me>,
      and use this parametrization along with Cauchy<nbsp/>'s integral formula to obtain
      <me>
        f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{f(z_0+Re^{i\theta})iRe^{i\theta}}{Re^{i\theta}}\,d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(z_0+Re^{i\theta})\,d\theta

    We now prove an important result concerning the modulus of an analytic function.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Max_Mod_Thm">
    <title>Maximum modulus principle</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be analytic and nonconstant in the domain <m>D</m>.
        Then <m>|f(z)|</m> does not attain a maximum value at any point <m>z_0</m> in <m>D</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (By contraposition): Assume the contrary and suppose that there exists a point <m>z_0</m> in <m>D</m> such that
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_asmptn">
        |f(z)| \le |f(z_0)|
      </men>
      holds for all <m>z</m> in <m>D</m>.
      If <m>C_R(z_0)</m> is any circle contained in <m>D</m>,
      <xref ref="Gauss_s_MVT">Theorems</xref>
      and <xref ref="ML_Inequality_Thm"></xref> imply that
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_1">
        |f(z_0)| = \left|\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}f(z_0+re^{i\theta})\,d\theta\right| \le \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}|f(z_0+re^{i\theta})|\,d\theta
      </men>,
      for <m>0 \le r \le R</m>.
      We now treat <m>|f(z)| = |f(z_0+re^{i\theta})|</m> as a real-valued function of the real variable <m>\theta</m> and use Inequality <xref ref="Max_Mod_asmptn"/> to get
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_2">
        \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} |f(z_0+re^{i\theta})|\,d\theta  \le \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}|f(z_0)|\,d\theta = |f(z_0)|
      </men>,
      for <m>0 \le r \le R</m>.
      Combining Inequalities <xref ref="Max_Mod_1"/> and <xref ref="Max_Mod_2"/> gives
      <me>
        |f(z_0)| = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}\big|f(z_0+re^{i\theta})\big|\,d\theta
      </me>,
      which we rewrite as
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_3">
        \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^{2\pi}\Big(\big|f(z_0)\big| - \big|f(z_0+re^{i\theta})\big|\Big)\,d\theta =0, \text{ for }   0 \le r \le R
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A theorem from calculus states that if the integral of a nonnegative continuous function taken over an interval is zero,
      then that function must be identically zero.
      Since Inequality <xref ref="Max_Mod_asmptn"/> implies that the integrand in Equation <xref ref="Max_Mod_3"/> is a nonnegative real-valued function,
      we conclude that it is identically zero; that is,
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_4">
        \big|f(z_0)\big| = \big|f(z_0+re^{i\theta})\big|,  \text{ for }   0 \le r \le R  \text{ and } 0 \le \theta  \le 2\pi
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the modulus of an analytic function is constant in a closed disk,
      then the function is constant in that closed disk by <xref ref="Abs_Const_implies_Const">Theorem</xref>.
      Therefore we conclude from Identity <xref ref="Max_Mod_4"/> that
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_5">
        f(z)=f(z_0),  \text{ for all } z \text{ in the closed disk }  \overline{D}_R(z_0)
      </men>,
      where <m>\overline{D}_R(z_0) = \{z:|z-z_0| \le R\}</m>.
      Now we let <m>\zeta</m> denote an arbitrary point in <m>D, \, C</m> be a contour in the original domain <m>D</m> that joins <m>z_0</m> to <m>\zeta</m>,
      and 2<m>d</m> denote the minimum distance from <m>C</m> to the boundary of <m>D</m>.
      We can find consecutive points <m>z_0,\,z_1,\,z_2, \ldots, \,z_n=\zeta</m> along <m>C</m>,
      with <m>|z_{k+1}-z_k| \le d</m>,
      such that the disks <m>D_k=\{z:|z-z_k| \le d\}</m>,
      for <m>k=0,\,1,\ldots ,\,n</m>,
      are contained in <m>D</m> and cover <m>C</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-34">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-34">
      <caption>The
      <q>chain of disks</q>
      <m>D_0,\ D_1,\ldots ,\ D_n</m> that cover <m>C</m></caption>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Each disk <m>D_k</m> contains the center <m>z_{k+1}</m> of the next disk <m>D_{k+1}</m>,
      so it follows that <m>z_1</m> lies in <m>D_0</m> and,
      from Equation <xref ref="Max_Mod_5"/> <m>|f(z)|</m> also reaches its maximum value at <m>z_1</m>.
      An identical argument to the one given above will show that
      <men xml:id="Max_Mod_6">
        f(z)=f(z_1)=f(z_0,  \text{ for all }  z \in D_1
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We proceed inductively to get
      <me>
        f(z) = f(z_{k+1}) = f(z_k),  \text{ for all }  z \in D_{k+1}, \; 0 \le k\lt n-1
      </me>,
      from which it follows that <m>f(\zeta )=f(z_0)</m>.
      Therefore <m>f</m> is constant in <m>D</m>,
      which contradicts the assumption of our theorem.
      With this contraposition, the proof is complete.

    We sometimes state the maximum modulus principle in the following form.

        Let <m>f(z)=az+b</m>.
        If we set our domain <m>D</m> to be <m>D_1(0)</m>,
        then <m>f</m> is continuous on the closed region <m>\overline{D}_1(0) = \{z:|z| \le 1\}</m>.
        Prove that

        From the triangle inequality and the fact that

        If <m>f</m> is an entire function and is bounded for all values of <m>z</m> in the complex plane,

      Suppose that <m>|f(z)| \le M</m> holds for all values of <m>z</m>,
      and let <m>z_0</m> denote an arbitrary point.
      Using the circle <m>C_R(z_0)=\{z:|z-z_0| =R\}</m> and Cauchy<nbsp/>'s Inequality with <m>n=1</m> yields

    We can use Liouville's theorem to establish an important theorem of elementary algebra.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="FTOA">
    <title>The fundamental theorem of algebra</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>P</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n \ge 1</m>,
        then <m>P</m> has at least one zero.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (By contraposition): We will show that if <m>P(z) \ne 0</m> for all <m>z</m>,
      then the degree of <m>P</m> must be zero.
      Suppose that <m>P(z) \ne 0</m> for all <m>z</m>.
      This supposition implies that the function
      <m>f(z) = \frac{1}{P(z)}</m> is an entire function.
      Our strategy for the rest of the proof is as follows: We will show that <m>f</m> is bounded.
      Then Liouville's theorem will imply that <m>f</m> is constant,
      and since <m>f=\frac{1}{P}</m>,
      this conclusion will imply that the polynomial <m>P</m> is constant,
      which will mean that its degree must be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we write <m>P(z)=a_nz^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1z+a_0</m> and consider the equation
      <men xml:id="FTOA_EQ_1">
        |f(z)| = \frac{1}{|P(z)|} = \frac{1}{|z|^n}\frac{1}{\left|a_n+\frac{a_{n-1}}{z} + \frac{a_{n-2}}{z^2}+\cdots +\frac{a_1}{z^{n-1}}+\frac{a_0}{z^n}\right|}
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <m>k=1,\ldots n</m>,
      <m>\frac{|a_{n-k}|}{|z^k|} \to 0</m> as <m>|z| \to \infty</m>, so
      <me>
        a_n+\frac{a_{n-1}}{z}+\frac{a_{n-2}}{z^2}+\cdots +\frac{a_0}{z^n} \to a_n,  \text{ as }   |z| \to \infty
      </me>.
      Combining this result with Equation <xref ref="FTOA_EQ_1"/> gives
      <me>
        |f(z)| \to 0,  \text{ as }   |z| \to \infty
      </me>.
      In particular, we can find a value of <m>R</m> such that
      <men xml:id="FTOA_EQ_2">
        |f(z)| \le 1  \text{ for all }   |z| \ge R

    <p>
      If <m>f(z)=u(x,y) +iv(x,y)</m>, we have
      <me>
        |f(z)| = \Big([u(x, y)]^2+[v(x,y)]^2\Big)^\frac{1}{2}
      </me>.
      which is a continuous function of the two real variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      A result from calculus regarding real functions says that a continuous function on a closed and bounded set is bounded.
      Hence <m>|f(z)|</m> is a bounded function on the closed disk <m>\overline{D}_R(0)</m>.
      Thus there exists a positive real number <m>K</m> such that
      <me>
        |f(z)| \le K,  \text{ for all }   |z| \le R
      </me>.
      Combining this with Inequality <xref ref="FTOA_EQ_2"/> gives
      <me>
        |f(z)| \le M  \text{ for all }  z
      </me>,
      where <m>M=\max \{K,1\}</m>.
      By Liouville's theorem, <m>f</m> is constant,
      so that the degree of <m>f</m> is zero.
      This observation completes the argument.
