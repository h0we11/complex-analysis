  <title>The Argument Principle &amp; Rouch&#xe9;'s Theorem</title>
  <p>
    We now derive two results based on Cauchy<nbsp/>'s residue theorem.
    They have important practical applications and pertain only to functions all of whose isolated singularities are poles.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <title>Meromorphic function</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f</m> is said to be meromorphic in a domain <m>D</m> provided the only singularities of <m>f</m> are isolated poles and removable singularities.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We make three important observations relating to this definition.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Analytic functions are a special case of meromorphic functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Rational functions <m>f(z) =\frac{{P(z)}}{{Q(z)}}</m>,
          where <m>P(z)</m> and <m>Q(z)</m> are polynomials,
          are meromorphic in the entire complex plane.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By definition,
          meromorphic functions have no essential singularities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that <m>f</m> is analytic at each point on a simple closed contour <m>C</m> and <m>f</m> is meromorphic in the domain that is the interior of <m>C</m>.
    We assert without proof that <xref ref="Isolated_Zeros_Thm">Theorem</xref>
    can be extended to meromorphic functions so that <m>f</m> has at most a finite number of zeros that lie inside <m>C</m>.
    Since the function <m>g(z)=\frac{1}{f(z)}</m> is also meromorphic,
    it can have only a finite number of zeros inside <m>C</m>,
    and so <m>f</m> can have at most a finite number of poles that lie inside <m>C</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following theorem, known as the argument principle,
    is useful in determining the number of zeros and poles that a function has.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Argument_Thm">
    <title>argument principle</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f</m><nbsp/>is meromorphic in the simply connected domain <m>D</m> and that <m>C</m><nbsp/>is a simple closed positively oriented contour in <m>D</m><nbsp/>such that <m>f</m> has no zeros or poles for <m>z\in C</m>.
        Then
        <men xml:id="Zeros_minus_Poles">

        where <m>Z_f</m><nbsp/>is the number of zeros of <m>f</m><nbsp/>that lie inside <m>C</m> and <m>P_f</m> is the number of poles of <m>f</m> that lie inside <m>C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>a_1, \, a_2, \, \ldots, \, a_{Z_f}</m> be the zeros of <m>f</m> inside <m>C</m> counted according to multiplicity and let
      <m>b_1, \, b_2, \, \ldots, \, b_{P_f}</m> be the poles of <m>f</m> inside <m>C</m> counted according to multiplicity.
      Then <m>f(z)</m> has the representation
      <me>
        f(z) = \frac{(z-a_1) (z-a_2) \cdots (z-a_{Z_f})}{(z-b_1)(z-b_2) \cdots (z-b_{P_f})}g(z)
      </me>,
      where <m>g</m> is analytic and nonzero on <m>C</m> and inside <m>C</m>.
      A standard calculation shows that
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)} \amp = \frac{1}{(z-a_1)} + \frac{1}{(z-a_2)} + \cdots + \frac{1}{(z-a_{Z_f})}</mrow>

      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="x2Pi_or_zero">Corollary</xref> then gives
      <md>

    </p>
    <p>
      The function <m>\frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}</m> is analytic inside and on <m>C</m>,
      so the Cauchy-Goursat theorem gives <m>\int_{C}\frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}\,dz=0</m>.
      These facts lead to the conclusion of our theorem if we integrate both sides of Equation <xref ref="f__f_rep"/> over <m>C</m>.

  <corollary xml:id="Int_f__f___N_Z_">

  <remark>
    <p>
      Certain feedback control systems in engineering must be stable.
      A test for stability involves the function <m>G(z) =1+F(z)</m>,
      where <m>F</m> is a rational function.
      If <m>G</m> does not have any zeros in the region <m>\{z:\mathrm{Re}(z) \ge 0\}</m>,
      then the system is stable.
      We determine the number of zeros of <m>G</m> by writing <m>F(z) =\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}</m>,
      where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are polynomials with no common zero.
      Then <m>G(z) =\frac{ Q(z) +P(z)}{Q(z)}</m>,
      and we can check for the zeros of
      <m>Q(z) +P(z)</m> by using <xref ref="Argument_Thm">Theorem</xref>.
      We select a value <m>R</m> so that <m>G(z) \ne 0</m> for
      <m>\{z:|z| >R\}</m> and then integrate along the contour consisting of the right half of the circle <m>C_R(0)</m> and the line segment between <m>iR</m> and <m>-iR</m>.
      This method is known as the <em>Nyquist stability criterion</em>.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <p>
    Why do we label <xref ref="Argument_Thm">Theorem</xref>
    as the <em>argument principle</em>?
    The answer lies with a fascinating application known as the
    <em> winding number</em>.
    Recall that a branch of the logarithm function,
    <m>\log_{\alpha}</m>, is defined by
    <me>
      \log_{\alpha}z=\ln |z| +i\arg_{\alpha}z=\ln r+i\phi
    </me>,
    where <m>z=re^{i\phi }\ne 0</m> and <m>\alpha \lt \phi \le \alpha +2\pi</m>.
    Loosely speaking, suppose that for some branch of the logarithm,
    the composite function <m>\log_{\alpha}(f(z) )</m> were analytic in a simply connected domain <m>D</m> containing the contour <m>C</m>.
    This would imply that <m>\log_{\alpha}\big(f(z)\big)</m> is an antiderivative of the function
    <m>\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>.
    <xref ref="DInt_Thm">Theorems</xref>
    and <xref ref="Argument_Thm"></xref> would then tell us that,
    as <m>z</m> winds around the curve <m>C</m>,
    the quantity <m>\log_{\alpha}(f(z) )=\ln |f(z)| +i\arg_{\alpha}f(z)</m> would change by <m>2\pi i(Z_f-P_f)</m>.
    Since <m>2\pi i(Z_f-P_f)</m> is purely imaginary,
    this result tells us that <m>\arg_{a}f(z)</m> would change by <m>2\pi (Z_f-P_f)</m> radians.
    In other words, as <m>z</m> winds around <m>C</m>,
    the integral <m>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C} \frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz</m> would count how many times the curve <m>f(C)</m> winds around the origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we can't always claim that
    <m>\log_{\alpha}\big(f(z)\big)</m> is an antiderivative of the function
    <m>\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}</m> for all <m>z \in D</m>.
    If it were, the Cauchy-Goursat theorem would imply that <m>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C} \frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}dz=0</m>.
    Nevertheless, the heuristics that we gave<mdash/>indicating that
    <m>\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}dz</m> counts how many times the curve <m>f(C)</m> winds around the origin<mdash/>still hold true,
    as we now demonstrate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that <m>C:z(t)=x(t)+iy(t)</m> for
    <m>a \le t \le b</m> is a simple closed contour and that we let
    <m>a=t_0\lt t_1\lt \cdots\lt t_n=b</m> be a partition of the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
    For <m>k=0,1,\ldots,n</m>,
    we let <m>z_k=z(t_k)</m> denote the corresponding points on <m>C</m>,
    where <m>z_0=z_n</m>.
    If <m>z^*</m> lies inside <m>C</m>,
    then the curve <m>C:z(t)</m> winds around <m>z^*</m> once as <m>t</m> goes from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-08-10">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now suppose that a function <m>f</m> is analytic at each point on <m>C</m> and meromorphic inside <m>C</m>.
    Then <m>f(C)</m> is a closed curve in the <m>w</m> plane that passes through the points <m>w_k=f(z_k)</m>,
    for <m>k=0,1,\ldots ,n</m>, where <m>w_0=w_n</m>.
    We can choose subintervals
    <m>[t_{k-1},t_k]</m> small enough so that,
    on the portion of <m>f(C)</m> between <m>w_{k-1}</m> and <m>w_k</m>,
    we can define a continuous branch of the logarithm
    <me>
      \log_{\alpha_k}w=\ln |w| +i\arg_{\alpha_k}w = \ln \rho +i\phi
    </me>,
    where <m>w=\rho e^{i\phi }</m> and <m>\alpha_k\lt \phi \lt \alpha_k+2\pi</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-08-11">Figure</xref>.
    Then
    <me>
      \log_{\alpha_k}f(z_k) -\log_{\alpha_k}f(z_{k-1}) = \ln \rho _k-\ln \rho _{k-1}+i\Delta \phi _k
    </me>,
    where <m>\Delta \phi _k=\phi _k-\phi _{k-1}</m> measures in radians the amount that the portion of the curve <m>f(C)</m> between <m>w_k</m> and <m>w_{k-1}</m> winds around the origin.
    With small enough subintervals <m>[ t_{k-1},t_k]</m>,
    the angles <m>\alpha_{k-1}</m> and <m>\alpha_k</m> might be different,
    but the values <m>\arg_{\alpha_{k-1}}w_{k-1}</m> and <m>\arg _{\alpha_k}w_{k-1}</m> will be the same,
    so that <m>\log_{\alpha_{k-1}}w_{k-1}=\log_{\alpha_k}w_{k-1}</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_ch-08-11">
    <caption>The points <m>z_k</m> on the contour <m>C</m> that winds around <m>z^*</m></caption>

  </figure>
  <p>
    We can now show why <m>\int_{C}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz</m> counts the number of times that <m>f(C)</m> winds around the origin.
    We parametrize <m>C:z(t)</m>, for <m>a\le t \le b</m>,
    and choose the appropriate branches of <m>\log_{\alpha_k}w</m>,giving
    <md>
      <mrow>\int_{C}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz \amp = \sum_{k=1}^n\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}\frac{f\,'\big(z(t)\big)}{f\big(z(t)\big)}z\,'(t)\,dt</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\log_{\alpha_k}\Big[f\big(z(t_k)\big)\Big] - \log_{\alpha_k}\Big[f\big(z(t_{k-1})\big)\Big]\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  =\sum\limits_{k=1}^n(\log_{\alpha_k}w_k-\log_{\alpha _k}w_{k-1})</mrow>
    </md>.
    which we rewrite as
    <men xml:id="Winding_Number_Eq">
      \int_{C}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz = \sum_{k=1}^n[\ln \rho _k-\ln \rho _{k-1}] + i\sum_{k=1}^n\Delta \phi _k
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we use the fact that <m>\rho _0=\rho _n</m>,
    the first summation in Equation <xref ref="Winding_Number_Eq"/> vanishes.
    The summation of the quantities
    <m>\Delta \phi _k</m> expresses the accumulated radian measure of <m>f(C)</m> around the origin.
    Therefore, when we divide both sides of Equation <xref ref="Winding_Number_Eq"/> by <m>2\pi i</m>,
    its right side becomes<nbsp/>an integer
    (by <xref ref="Argument_Thm">Theorem</xref>)
    that must count the number of times <m>f(C)</m> winds around the origin.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="Winding_Ex">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The image of the circle <m>C_2(0)</m> under
        <m>f(z)=z^2+z</m> is the curve given by
        <m>\{(x,y) =(4\cos 2t+2\cos t,4\sin 2t+2\sin t) :0\lt t\lt 2\pi \}</m> shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-08-12">Figure</xref>.

      <figure xml:id="fig_ch-08-12">

        <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-08/ch-08-fig-12.svg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Note that the image curve <m>f\big(C_2(0)\big)</m> winds twice around the origin.
        We check this by computing <m>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_2^{+}(0)}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_2^{+}(0)}\frac{ 2z+1}{z^2+z}dz</m>.
        The residues of the integrand are at <m>0</m> and <m>-1</m>.
        Thus
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_2^{+}(0)}\frac{2z+1}{z^2+z}dz \amp = \mathrm{Res}\left[\frac{2z+1}{z^2+z},0\right] +\mathrm{Res}\left[\frac{2z+1}{z^2+z},-1\right]</mrow>

          <mrow>\amp = 2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Finally, we note that if <m>g(z) =f(z) -a</m>,
    then <m>g\,'(z) =f(z)</m>,
    and thus we can generalize what we've just said to compute how many times the curve <m>f(C)</m> winds around the point <m>a</m>.

      which counts the number of times the curve <m>C</m> winds around the point <m>a</m>.
      If <m>C</m> is not a simple closed curve,

      that <m>W(C,a)</m> still gives the number of times the curve <m>C</m> winds around the point <m>a</m>.
      Thus <em>winding number</em> is indeed an appropriate term.

    We close this section with a result that will help us gain information about the location of the zeros and poles of meromorphic functions.

  <theorem xml:id="Rouche_s_Thm">
    <title>Rouch&#xe9;'s theorem</title>

    <p>
      Because <m>g</m> has no zeros or poles on <m>C</m>,
      we may legitimately divide both sides of the inequality
      <m>|f(z)+g(z)| \lt  |f(z)| + |g(z)|</m> by <m>|g(z)|</m> to get
      <men xml:id="Rouche_criterion">

    </p>
    <p>
      For <m>z \in C, \; \frac{f(z)}{g(z)}</m> cannot possibly be zero or any positive real number,
      as that would contradict <xref ref="Rouche_criterion">Inequality</xref>.
      This means that <m>C^*</m>,
      the image of the curve <m>C</m> under the mapping <m>\frac{f}{g}</m>,
      does not contain the interval <m>[0,\infty)</m>,
      and so the function defined by
      <me>
        w(z) = \log_0 \left(\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}\right) = \ln\left|\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}\right|+i\arg_0\left(\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}\right)=\ln r+i\phi

      where <m>\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}=re^{i\phi }\ne 0</m> and <m>0\lt \phi \le 2\pi</m>,
      is analytic in a simply connected domain <m>D^*</m> that contains <m>C^*</m>.
      We calculate

        w\,'(z) =\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)} - \frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}

      so <m>w(z) =\log_0(\frac{f(z)}{g(z)})</m> is an antiderivative of
      <m>\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}-\frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}</m>, for all <m>z \in D^*</m>.
      Since <m>C^*</m> is a closed curve in <m>D^*</m>,
      <xref ref="DInt_Thm">Theorem</xref>
      gives <m>\int_{C^*}\left(\frac{ f\,'(z)}{f(z)}-\frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}\right)dz=0</m>.
      According to <xref ref="Argument_Thm">Theorem</xref> then,
      <me>
        \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C^*}\frac{f\,'(z)}{f(z)}\,dz-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C^*}\frac{g\,'(z)}{g(z)}\,dz=(Z_f-P_f)-(Z_g-P_g)=0

      which completes the proof.

      is usually stated with the requirement that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> satisfy the condition <m>|f(z)+g(z)|\lt |g(z)|</m>,
      for <m>z \in C</m>.
      The improved theorem that we gave was discovered by Irving Glicksberg (see the
      <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em>, 83 (1976), pp. 186-187).
      The weaker version is adequate for most purposes, however,
      as the following examples illustrate.

  </remark>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that all four zeros of the polynomial
        <m>g(z)=z^4-7z-1</m> lie in the disk <m>D_2(0) =\{z:|z|\lt 2\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(z) =-z^4</m>.
        Then <m>f(z) +g(z)=-7z-1</m>,
        and at points on the circle<nbsp/><m>C_2(0) =\{z:|z| =2\}</m> we have the relation
        <me>
          |f(z)+g(z)| \le |-7z| + |-1| = 7(2) + 1 \lt  16 = |f(z)|
        </me>.
        Of course, if <m>|f(z)+g(z)|\lt |f(z)|</m>,
        then as we indicated in <xref ref="remark_8_5">Remark</xref>
        we certainly have <m>|f(z)+g(z)|\lt |f(z)|+|g(z)|</m>,
        so that the conditions for applying <xref ref="Rouche_s_Cor">Corollary</xref>
        are satisfied on the circle <m>C_2(0)</m>.
        The function <m>f</m> has a zero of order <m>4</m> at the origin,
        so <m>g</m> must have four zeros inside <m>D_2(0)</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that the polynomial <m>g(z) =z^4-7z-1</m> has one zero in the disk <m>D_1(0)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(z) =7z+1</m>, then <m>f(z)+g(z)=z^4</m>.
        At points on the circle <m>C_1(0) =\{z:|z| =1\}</m> we have the relation
        <me>
          |f(z)+g(z)| = |z^4| = 1 \lt 6 = |7| - |1| \le |7z+1| = |f(z)|
        </me>.
        The function <m>f</m> has one zero at the point
        <m>-\frac{1}{7}</m> in the disk <m>D_1(0)</m>,
        and the hypotheses of <xref ref="Rouche_s_Cor">Corollary</xref>
        hold on the circle <m>C_1(0)</m>.
        Therefore <m>g</m> has one zero inside <m>D_1(0)</m>.
