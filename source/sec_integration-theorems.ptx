  <title>The Fundamental Theorems of Integration</title>
  <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be analytic in the simply connected domain <m>D</m>.
    The theorems in this section show that an antiderivative <m>F</m> can be constructed by contour integration.
    A consequence will be the fact that in a simply connected domain,
    the integral of an analytic function <m>f</m> along any contour joining <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_2</m> is the same,
    and its value is given by <m>F(z_2) -F(z_1)</m>.
    As a result,
    we can use the antiderivative formulas from calculus to compute the value of definite integrals.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Antideriv_Thm">
    <title>Indefinite integrals, or antiderivatives</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m><nbsp/>be analytic in the simply connected domain <m>D</m>.
        If <m>z_0</m> is a fixed value in <m>D</m>,
        and if <m>C</m> is any contour in <m>D</m> with initial point <m>z_0</m> and terminal point <m>z</m>,
        then the function
        <men xml:id="Antideriv_Eq">
          F(z)=\int_Cf(\xi )\,d\xi = \int_{z_0}^{z}f(\xi)\,d\xi
        </men>
        is well-defined and analytic in <m>D</m>,
        with its derivative given by <m>F\,'(z)=f(z)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We first establish that the integral is independent of the path of integration.
      This will show that the function <m>F</m> is well-def<em>i.e.</em>,
      which in turn will justify the notation <m>F(z)=\int_{z_0}^zf(\xi)\,d\xi</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We let <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> be two contours in <m>D</m>,
      both with initial point <m>z_0</m> and terminal point <m>z</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-30">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-30">
      <caption>The contours <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> joining <m>z_0</m> to <m>z</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-06/ch-06-fig-30.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Then <m>C_1-C_2</m> is a simple closed contour,
      and the Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that
      <me>
        \int_{C_1}f(\xi)\,d\xi -\int_{C_2}f(\xi)\,d\xi = \int_{C_1-C_2}f(\xi)\,d\xi = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the contour integral in Equation <xref ref="Antideriv_Eq"/> is independent of path.
      Here we have taken the liberty of drawing contours that intersect only at the endpoints.
      A slight modification of the proof shows that a finite number of other points of intersection are permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now show that <m>F\,'(z)=f(z)</m>.
      Let <m>z</m> be held fixed,
      and let <m>\left\vert \Delta z\right\vert</m> be chosen small enough so that the point
      <m>z+\Delta z</m> also lies in the domain <m>D</m>.
      Since <m>z</m> is held fixed, <m>f(z)=K</m>,
      where <m>K</m> is a constant,
      and Equation <xref ref="Int_Prop_6"/> implies that
      <men xml:id="Ad_Eq_1">
        \int_z^{z+\Delta z}f(z)\,d\xi = \int_z^{z+\Delta z}K\,d\xi = K \Delta z = f(z) \Delta z
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the additive property of contours and the definition of <m>F</m> given in Equation <xref ref="Antideriv_Eq"/>, we have
      <md>
        <mrow>F(z+\Delta z) -F(z) \amp = \int_{z_0}^{z+\Delta z}f(\xi)\,d\xi -\int_{z_0}^{z}f(\xi)\,d\xi</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="Ad_Eq_2" number="yes">\amp = \int_{\Gamma _2}f(\xi)\,d\xi -\int_{\Gamma _1}f(\xi)\,d\xi =\int_{\Gamma}f(\xi)\,d\xi</mrow>
      </md>.
      where the contour <m>\Gamma</m> is the straight-line segment joining <m>z</m> to <m>z+\Delta z</m>,
      and <m>\Gamma_1</m> and <m>\Gamma_2</m> join <m>z_0</m> to <m>z</m>,
      and <m>z_0</m> to <m>z+\Delta z</m>, respectively,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-31">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-31">
      <caption>The contours <m>\Gamma _1</m> and <m>\Gamma _2</m> and the line segment <m>\Gamma</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-06/ch-06-fig-31.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Since <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>z</m>,
      for any <m>\varepsilon >0</m> there is a <m>\delta>0</m> so that
      <me>
        |f(\xi )-f(z)| \lt  \varepsilon  \text{ when }   |\xi -z| \lt  \delta
      </me>.
      If we require that <m>\left\vert \Delta z\right\vert \lt \delta</m> and combine this last inequality with Equations <xref ref="Ad_Eq_1"/> and <xref ref="Ad_Eq_2"/>, and <xref ref="ML_Ineq">Theorem</xref>, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>\left|\frac{F(z+\Delta z) -F(z)}{\Delta z} -f(z)\right| \amp = \frac{1}{|\Delta z|} \left\vert \int_{\Gamma }f(\xi)\,d\xi - \int_{\Gamma }f(z)\,d\xi \right\vert</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \le \frac{1}{|\Delta z|}\int_{\Gamma}\big|f(\xi ) -f(z)\big|  \big|d\xi\big|</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \lt  \frac{1}{|\Delta z|}\varepsilon |\Delta z|</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \varepsilon </mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus <m>\left|\frac{F(z+\Delta z) -F(z)}{\Delta z}-f(z)\right|</m> tends to 0 as
      <m>\Delta z \to 0</m>, so <m>F\,'(z)=f(z)</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <remark>
    <p>
      It is important to stress that the line integral of an analytic function is independent of path.
      In <xref ref="Int_z_two_ways">Example</xref>
      we showed that <m>\int_{C_1}z\ dz=\int_{C_2}z\ dz=4+2i</m>,
      where <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> were different contours joining <m>-1-i</m> to <m>3+i</m>.
      Because the integrand <m>f(z)=z</m> is an analytic function,
      <xref ref="Antideriv_Thm">Theorem</xref>
      lets us know ahead of time that the value of the two integrals is the same;
      hence one calculation would have sufficed.
      If you ever have to compute a line integral of an analytic function over a difficult contour,
      change the contour to something easier.
      You are guaranteed to get the same answer.
      Of course, you must be sure that the function you're dealing with is analytic in a simply connected domain containing your original and new contours.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <p>
    If we set <m>z=z_1</m> in <xref ref="Antideriv_Thm">Theorem</xref>,
    then we obtain the following familiar result for evaluating a definite integral of an analytic function.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="DInt_Thm">
    <title>Definite integrals</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be analytic in a simply connected domain <m>D</m>.
        If <m>z_0</m> and <m>z_1</m> are any two points in <m>D</m> joined by a contour <m>C</m>, then
        <men xml:id="DInt_Eq">
          \int_Cf(z)\,dz = \int_{z_0}^{z_1}f(z)\,dz=F(z_1) - F(z_0)
        </men>,
        where <m>F</m> is any antiderivative of <m>f</m> in <m>D</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If we choose <m>F</m> to be the function defined by Formula <xref ref="Antideriv_Eq"/>, then Equation <xref ref="DInt_Eq"/> holds.
      If <m>G</m> is any other antiderivative of <m>f</m> in <m>D</m>,
      then <m>G\,'(z)=F\,'(z)</m> for all <m>z\in D</m>.
      Thus the function <m>H(z)=G(z) -F(z)</m> is analytic in <m>D</m>,
      and <m>H\,'(z) = G\,'(z)-F\,'(z) = 0</m>, for all <m>z\in D</m>.
      Thus, by <xref ref="Df_0_implies_f_const">Theorem</xref>,
      this means <m>H(z)=K</m>,
      for all <m>z\in D</m>, where <m>K</m> is some complex constant.
      Therefore <m>G(z)=F(z) +K</m>,
      so <m>G(z_1)-G(z_0) = F(z_1)-F(z_0)</m>,
      which establishes our theorem.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    <xref ref="DInt_Thm">Theorem</xref>
    gives an important method for evaluating definite integrals when the integrand is an analytic function in a simply connected domain.
    In essence, it permits you to use all the rules of integration that you learned in calculus.
    When the conditions of <xref ref="DInt_Thm">Theorem</xref> are met,
    applying it is generally much easier than parametrizing a contour.

        We showed in Chapter 3 that if <m>F(z)=z^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>,

        where the principal branch of the square root function is used in both the formulas for <m>F</m> and <m>F\,'</m>.
