  <title>The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The Cauchy-Goursat theorem states that within certain domains the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed contour is zero.
    An extension of this theorem allows us to replace integrals over certain complicated contours with integrals over contours that are easy to evaluate.
    We demonstrate how to use the technique of partial fractions with the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to evaluate certain integrals.
    In <xref ref="sec_integration-theorems">Section</xref>
    we show that the Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that an analytic function has an antiderivative.
    To begin, we need to introduce some new concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall from <xref ref="sec_topology">Section</xref>
    that each simple closed contour <m>C</m> divides the plane into two domains.
    One domain is bounded and is called the interior of <m>C</m>;
    the other domain is unbounded and is called the exterior of <m>C</m>.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-06-15">Figure</xref> illustrates this concept,
    which is known as the Jordan curve theorem.
  </p>

    Recall also that a domain <m>D</m> is a connected open set.
    In particular,
    if <m>z_1</m> and <m>z_2</m> are any pair of points in <m>D</m>,
    then they can be joined by a curve that lies entirely in <m>D</m>.
    A domain <m>D</m> is said to be a
    <em> simply connected domain</em>
    if the interior of any simple closed contour <m>C</m> contained in <m>D</m> is contained in <m>D</m>.
    In other words, there are no
    <q>holes</q>
    in a simply connected domain.
    A domain that is not simply connected is called a multiply connected domain.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-06-16">Figure</xref>
    illustrates uses of the terms <em>simply connected</em>
    and <em>multiply connected</em>.

  <p>
    Let the simple closed contour <m>C</m> have the parametrization
    <m>C:z(t)=x(t) +iy(t)</m> for <m>a \le t \le b</m>.
    Recall that if <m>C</m> is parametrized so that the interior of <m>C</m> is kept on the left as <m>z(t)</m> moves around <m>C</m>,
    then we say that <m>C</m> is oriented
    <em>positively</em> (counterclockwise);
    otherwise, <m>C</m> is oriented
    <em>negatively</em> (clockwise)<em>.</em>
    If <m>C</m> is positively oriented,
    then <m>-C</m> is negatively oriented.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-06-17">Figure</xref>
    illustrates the concept of positive and negative orientation.

    Green's theorem is an important result from the calculus of real variables.
    It tells you how to evaluate the line integral of real-valued functions.

  <theorem xml:id="Green_s_Thm">
    <title>Green's theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>

        </men>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (We give a proof for a <em>standard region</em>,
      which is a region that is bounded by a contour <m>C</m> tha can be expressed in the two forms <m>C=C_1+C_2</m> and
      <m>C=C_3+C_4</m>.) If <m>R</m> is a standard region,
      then there exist functions <m>y=g_1(x)</m>,
      and <m>y=g_2(x)</m>, for <m>a \le x \le b</m>,
      whose graphs form the lower and upper portions of <m>C</m>,
      respectively,
      as indicated in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-18">Figure</xref>.
      As <m>C</m> is positively oriented,
      these functions can be used to express <m>C</m> as the sum of two contours <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>, where
      <md>
        <mrow>{3} \amp  C_1 : z_1(t) = t+ig_1(t), \amp \amp   \text{ for }    \amp \amp  a \le t \le b, \text{ and }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  C_2 : z_2(t) = -t+ig_2(-t), \amp \amp   \text{ for }   \amp \amp  -b \le t \le -a</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now use the functions <m>g_1(x)</m> and <m>g_2(x)</m> to express the double integral of
      <m>-P_y(x,y)</m> over <m>R</m> as an iterated integral,
      first with respect to <m>y</m> and second with respect to <m>x</m>:
      <me>
        -\iint_RP_y(x,y)\,dx\,dy = -\int_a^b\left[\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}P_y(x,y)\,dy\right]dx
      </me>.
      Computing the first iterated integral on the right side gives
      <me>
        -\iint_RP_y(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \int_a^bP\big(x,\,g_1(x)\big)\,dx - \int_a^bP\big(x,\,g_2(x)\big)\,dx
      </me>.
      In the second integral on the right side of this equation we can use the change of variable <m>x=-t</m> to obtain
      <me>
        -\iint_RP_y(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \int_a^bP\big(x,\, g_1(x)\big)\,dx + \int_{-b}^{-a}P\big(-t,\,g_2(-t)\big)(-1)\,dt
      </me>

      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-06/ch-06-fig-18.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Interpreting the two integrals on the right side of this equation as contour integrals along <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>,
      respectively, gives
      <men xml:id="Green1">
        -\iint\limits_RP_y(x,y)\,dx\,dy =\int_{C_1}P(x,y)\,dx + \int_{C_2}P(x,y)\,dx = \int_CP(x,y)\,dx
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complete the proof,
      we rely on the fact that for a standard region there exist functions
      <m>x=h_1(y)</m> and <m>x=h_2(y)</m> for
      <m>c \le y \le d</m> whose graphs form the left and right portions of <m>C</m>,

    </figure>
    <p>
      Because <m>C</m> has positive orientation,
      it can be expressed as the sum of two contours <m>C_3</m> and <m>C_4</m>, where
      <md>
        <mrow>{3} \amp  C_3 : z_3(t) = h_1(-t) -it,  \amp \amp  \text{ for }   \amp \amp  -d \le t \le -c,  \text{ and }</mrow>

      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the functions <m>h_1(y)</m> and <m>h_2(y)</m>,
      we express the double integral of
      <m>Q_x(x.y)</m> over <m>R</m> as an iterated integral:
      <me>
        \iint\limits_RQ_x(x,y)\,dx\,dy = \int_c^{d} \left[\int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)}Q_x(x,y)\,dx\right] dy
      </me>.
      A derivation similar to that which led to Equation <xref ref="Green1"/> shows that
      <men xml:id="Green2">
        \iint\limits_RQ_x(x\text{,} y)\,dx\,dy = \int_CQ(x,y)\,dy
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding Equations <xref ref="Green1"/> and <xref ref="Green2"/> gives Equation <xref ref="Green_s_Thm_Eq"/>.

    We are now ready to state the main result of this section.

  <theorem xml:id="CG_Thm">
    <title>Cauchy-Goursat theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be analytic in a simply connected domain <m>D</m>.
        If <m>C</m> is a simple closed contour that lies in <m>D</m>, then

          \int_Cf(z)\,dz=0
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    We give two proofs.
    The first, by Augustin Cauchy,
    is more intuitive but requires the additional hypothesis that <m>f\,'</m> is continuous.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (Cauchy<nbsp/>'s proof of <xref ref="CG_Thm">Theorem</xref>.) If we suppose that <m>f\,'</m> is continuous,
      then with <m>C</m> oriented positively we use Equation <xref ref="bookkeeping"/> to write
      <men xml:id="CG0">
        \int_Cf(z)\,dz = \int_Cu\ dx-v\,dy+i\int_Cv\,dx + u\,dy
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we use Green's theorem on the real part of the right side of Equation <xref ref="CG0"/> (with <m>P=u</m> and <m>Q=-v)</m>,
      we obtain
      <men xml:id="CG1">
        \int_Cu\,dx - v\,dy = \iint\limits_R(-v_x-u_y)\,dx\,dy
      </men>,
      where <m>R</m> is the region that is the interior of <m>C</m>.
      If we use Green's theorem on the imaginary part, we get
      <men xml:id="CG2">
        \int_Cv\,dx +u\,dy = \iint\limits_R(u_x-v_y)\,dx\,dy
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations <m>u_x=v_y</m> and
      <m>u_y=-v_x</m> in Equations <xref ref="CG1"/> and <xref ref="CG2"/>, Equation <xref ref="CG0"/> becomes

        \int_Cf(z)\,dz = \iint\limits_R0\,dx\ dy +i\iint\limits_R0\,dx\,dy=0

      which completes the proof.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    In 1883, Edward Goursat (1858-1936) produced a proof that does not require the continuity of <m>f\,'</m>.

      We first establish the result for a triangular contour <m>C</m> with positive orientation.
      We then construct four positively oriented contours <m>C^1</m>,
      <m>C^2</m>,
      <m>C^3</m>,
      and <m>C^4</m> that are the triangles obtained by joining the midpoints of the sides of <m>C</m>,
      as <xref ref="fig_ch-06-20">Figure</xref> shows.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-06-20">

    </figure>
    <p>
      Each contour is positively oriented,
      so if we sum the integrals along the four triangular contours,
      the integrals along the segments interior to <m>C</m> cancel out in pairs, giving
      <men xml:id="CG2_25">
        \int_Cf(z)\,dz = \sum\limits_{k=1}^4\int_{C^k}f(z)\,dz
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>C_1</m> be selected from <m>C^1</m>, <m>C^2</m>,
      <m>C^3</m>, and <m>C^4</m> so that the following holds:

        \left| \int_Cf(z)\,dz \right| \le \sum_{k=1}^4 \left|\int_{C^k}f(z)\,dz\right|  \le 4\left|\int_{C_1}f(z)\,dz\right|
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding inductively,
      we carry out a similar subdivision process to obtain a sequence of triangular contours <m>\{C_n\}</m>,
      where the interior of <m>C_{n+1}</m> lies in the interior of <m>C_n</m> and the following inequality holds:
      <men xml:id="CG2_5">
        \left|\int_{C_n}f(z)\,dz\right| \le 4\left|\int_{C_{n+1}}f(z)\,dz\right|,  \text{ for }   n=1,\,2,\ldots
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      We let <m>T_n</m> denote the closed region that consists of <m>C_n</m> and its interior.
      The length of the sides of <m>C_n</m> go to zero as <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      so there exists a unique point <m>z_0</m> that belongs to all the closed triangular regions <m>\{T_n\}</m>.
      Since <m>D</m> is simply connected,
      <m>z_0\in D</m>, so <m>f</m> is analytic at the point <m>z_0</m>.
      Thus, there exists a function <m>\eta (z)</m> such that
      <men xml:id="CG3">
        f(z) = f(z_0) + f\,'(z_0)(z-z_0) + \eta (z)(z-z_0),  \text{ where }   \lim\limits_{z \to z_0}\eta (z)=0
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Equation <xref ref="CG3"/> and integrating <m>f</m> along <m>C_n</m>, we get
      <md>
        <mrow>\int_{C_n}f(z)\,dz \amp = \int_{C_n}f(z_0)\,dz + \int_{C_n}f'(z_0) (z-z_0) dz</mrow>

        <mrow>\amp = \int_{C_n}\eta(z)(z-z_0)\,dz</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\lim\limits_{z \to z_0}\eta (z)=0</m>,
      we know that given <m>\varepsilon >0</m>,
      we can find <m>\delta >0</m> such that
      <men xml:id="CG4">
        |z-z_0| \lt  \delta  \text{ implies that }   |\eta (z)| \lt  \frac{2}{L^2} \varepsilon
      </men>,
      where <m>L</m> is the length of the original contour <m>C</m>.
      We can now choose an integer <m>n</m> so that <m>C_n</m> lies in the neighborhood
      <m>z-z_0| \lt  \delta</m>, as shown in Figure 6.21.

    <p>
      Since the distance between any point <m>z</m> on a triangle and a point <m>z_0</m> interior to the triangle is less than half the perimeter of the triangle,
      it follows that

        |z-z_0| \lt  \frac{1}{2} L_n,  \text{ for all }  z \text{ on }  C_n
      </me>,
      where <m>L_n</m> is the length of the triangle <m>C_n</m>.
      From the preceding construction process, it follows that
      <men xml:id="CG5">
        L_n=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!n}L,  \text{ and }   |z-z_0| \lt  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\! n+1}L,  \text{ for } z \text{ on } C_n

    <p>
      We can use Equations <xref ref="CG2_5"/>, <xref ref="CG4"/>,

    <p>
      Because <m>\varepsilon</m> was arbitrary,
      it follows that our theorem holds for the triangular contour <m>C</m>.
      If <m>C</m> is a polygonal contour,
      then we can add interior edges until the interior is subdivided into a finite number of triangles.
      The integral around each triangle is zero,
      and the sum of all these integrals equals the integral around the polygonal contour <m>C</m>.
      Therefore our theorem also holds for polygonal contours.
      The proof for an arbitrary simple closed contour is established by approximating the contour
      <q>sufficiently close</q>
      with a polygonal contour.
      We omit the details of this last step.

      Assume that both <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> have positive (counterclockwise) orientation.
      We construct two disjoint contours or <em>cuts</em>,
      <m>L_1</m> and <m>L_2</m>, that join <m>C_1</m> to <m>C_2</m>.
      The contour <m>C_1</m> is cut into two contours
      <m>C_1^{\ast }</m> and <m>C_1^{\ast \ast }</m>,
      and the contour <m>C_2</m> is cut into <m>C_2^*</m> and <m>C_2^{\ast \ast}</m>.
      We now form two new contours:
      <me>
        K_1=-C_1^{\ast }+L_1+C_2^{\ast }-L_2  \text{ and }   K_2 = -C_1^{\ast \ast }+L_2+C_2^{\ast \ast }-L_1
      </me>,
      which are shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-24">Figure</xref>.
      The function <m>f</m> will be analytic on a simply connected domain <m>D_1</m> that contains <m>K_1</m>,
      and <m>f</m> will be analytic on the simply<nbsp/>connected domain <m>D_2</m> that contains <m>K_2</m>,
      as illustrated in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-24">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      We apply the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to the contours <m>K_1</m> and <m>K_2</m>, giving

    We now state as a corollary an important result that is implied by the deformation<nbsp/>of contour theorem.

    The deformation of contour theorem is an extension of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to a doubly connected domain in the following sense.
    We let <m>D</m> be a domain that contains <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> and the region between them,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-06-23">Figure</xref>.
    Then the contour <m>C=C_2-C_1</m> is a parametrization of the boundary of the region <m>R</m> that lies between <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> so that the points of <m>R</m> lie to the left of <m>C</m> as a point <m>z(t)</m> moves around <m>C</m>.
    Hence <m>C</m> is a positive orientation of the boundary of <m>R</m>,
    and <xref ref="Deformation_of_Contour">Theorem</xref>
    implies that <m>\int_C f(z)\,dz=0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can extend <xref ref="Deformation_of_Contour">Theorem</xref>
