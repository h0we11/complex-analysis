  <title>Bilinear Transformations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Another important class of elementary mappings was studied by Augustus Ferdinand M&#xf6;bius (1790<ndash/>1868).
      These mappings are conveniently expressed as the quotient of two linear expressions.
      They arise naturally in mapping problems involving the function <m>\mathrm{Arctan}(z)</m>.
      In this section,
      we show how they are used to map a disk one-to-one and onto a half-plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we let <m>a,  \, b, \, c</m>,
      and <m>d</m> denote four complex constants with the restriction that <m>ad\ne  bc</m>,
      then the function
      <men xml:id="bilineardef">
        w=S(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}
      </men>
      is called a bilinear transformation,
      a <em>M&#xf6;bius transformation</em>,
      or a linear fractional transformation.
      If the expression for <m>S</m> in Equation <xref ref="bilineardef"/> is multiplied by the quantity <m>cz+d</m>,
      then the resulting expression has the bilinear form <m>cwz-az+dw-b=0</m>.
      We collect terms involving <m>z</m> and write <m>z(cw-a)=-dw+b</m>.
      Then, for values of <m>w\ne \frac{a}{c}</m>,
      the inverse transformation is given by
      <men xml:id="bilinearinv">
        z=S^{-1}(w) =\frac{-dw+b}{cw-a}
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can extend <m>S</m> and <m>S^{-1}</m> to mappings in the extended complex plane.
      The value <m>S(\infty)</m> should equal the limit of <m>S(z)</m> as <m>z \to \infty</m>.
      Therefore we define
      <me>
        S(\infty) = \lim_{z \to \infty} S(z) = \lim_{z \to \infty} \frac{a+\frac{b}{z}}{c+\frac{d}{z}}=\frac{a}{c}
      </me>,
      and the inverse is <m>S^{-1}(\frac{a}{c})=\infty</m>.
      Similarly, the value <m>S^{-1}(\infty)</m> is obtained by
      <me>
        S^{-1}(\infty) = \lim_{w \to \infty}\ S^{-1}(w) = \lim_{w \to \infty} \frac{-d+\frac{b}{w}}{c-\frac{a}{w}}=\frac{-d}{c}
      </me>,
      and the inverse is <m>S(\frac{-d}{c})=\infty</m>.
      With these extensions we conclude that the transformation <m>w=S(z)</m> is a one-to-one mapping of the extended complex <m>z</m> plane onto the extended complex <m>w</m> plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now show that a bilinear transformation carries the class of circles and lines onto itself.
      If <m>S</m> is an arbitrary bilinear transformation given by Equation <xref ref="bilineardef"/> and <m>c=0</m>,
      then <m>S</m> reduces to a linear transformation,
      which carries lines onto lines and circles onto circles.
      If <m>c\ne 0</m>, then we can write <m>S</m> in the form
      <men xml:id="bilinearexpand">
        S(z) = \frac{a(cz+d)+bc-ad}{c(cz+d)} = \frac{a}{c}+\left(\frac{bc-ad}{c}\right)\!\left(\frac{1}{cz+d}\right)
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition <m>ad \ne bc</m> precludes the possibility that <m>S</m> reduces to a constant.
      Equation <xref ref="bilinearexpand"/> indicates that <m>S</m> can be considered as a composition of functions.
      It is a linear mapping <m>\xi =cz+d</m>,
      followed by the reciprocal transformation <m>Z=\frac{1}{\xi }</m>,
      followed by <m>w=\frac{a}{c}+\frac{bc-ad}{c}Z</m>.
      In <xref ref="ch_complex-functions"/> we showed that each function in this composition maps the class of circles and lines onto itself;
      it follows that the bilinear transformation <m>S</m> has this property.
      A half-plane can be considered to be a family of parallel lines and a disk as a family of circles.
      Therefore we conclude that a bilinear transformation maps the class of half-planes and disks onto itself.
      <xref ref="ex_9_3">Example</xref> illustrates this idea.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_9_3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>w=S(z)=\frac{i(1-z)}{1+z}</m> maps the unit disk
          <m>\left\vert z\right\vert \lt 1</m> one-to-one and onto the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) >0</m>.
        </p>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We first consider the unit circle <m>C:|z|=1</m>,
            which forms the boundary of the disk and find its image in the <m>w</m> plane.
            If we write <m>S(z)=\frac{-iz+i}{z+1}</m>,
            then we see that <m>a=-i, \, b=i \, c=1</m>, and <m>d=1</m>.
            Using Equation <xref ref="bilinearinv"/>, we find that the inverse is given by
            <men xml:id="bilinearinv2">
              z=S^{-1}(w)=\frac{-dw+b}{cw-a}=\frac{-w+i}{w+i}
            </men>.
          </p>
        </solution>
        <p>
          If <m>|z|=1</m>,
          then Equation <xref ref="bilinearinv2"/> implies that the images of points on the unit circle satisfy the equation
          <men xml:id="ptsoncircle">
            |w+i| = |-w+i|
          </men>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Squaring both sides of Equation <xref ref="ptsoncircle"/>,
          we obtain <m>u^2+(1+v)^2=u^2+(1-v)^2</m>,
          which can be simplified to yield <m>v=0</m>,
          which is the equation of the <m>u</m>-axis in the <m>w</m> plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circle <m>C</m> divides the <m>z</m> plane into two portions,
          and its image is the <m>u</m>-axis,
          which divides the <m>w</m> plane into two portions.
          The image of the point <m>z=0</m> is <m>w=S(0) =i</m>,
          so we expect that the interior of the circle <m>C</m> is mapped onto the portion of the <m>w</m> plane that lies above the <m>u</m>-axis.
          To show that this outcome is true,
          we let <m>|z| \lt 1</m> . Then Equation <xref ref="bilinearinv2"/> implies that the image values must satisfy the inequality <m>|-w+i| \lt  |w+i|</m>,
          which we write as
          <me>
            d_1 = |w-i| \lt  |w-(-i)| = d_2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we interpret <m>d_1</m> as the distance from <m>w</m> to <m>i</m> and <m>d_2</m> as the distance from <m>w</m> to <m>-i</m>,
          then a geometric argument shows that the image point <m>w</m> must lie in the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w)>0</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-09-05">Figure</xref>.
          As <m>S</m> is one-to-one and onto in the extended complex plane,
          it follows that <m>S</m> maps the disk onto the half-plane.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      The general formula for a bilinear transformation (Equation <xref ref="bilineardef"/>) appears to involve four independent coefficients:
      <m>a, \, b, \, c</m>, and <m>d</m>.
      But as <m>S(z) \ne  K</m>, either <m>a \ne 0</m> or <m>c \ne 0</m>,
      we can express the transformation with three unknown coefficients and write either
      <me>
        S(z) = \frac{z+\frac{b}{a}}{\frac{cz}{a}+\frac{d}{a}},  \text{ or }   S(z) = \frac{\frac{az}{c}+\frac{b}{c}}{z+\frac{d}{c}}
      </me>,
      respectively.
      Doing so permits us to determine a unique a bilinear transformation if three distinct image values <m>S(z_1)=w_1, \, S(z_2)=w_2</m>,
      and <m>S(z_3)=w_3</m> are specified.
      To determine such a mapping,
      we can conveniently use an implicit formula involving <m>z</m> and <m>w</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <title>The implicit formula</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There exists a unique bilinear transformation that maps three distinct points,
          <m>z_1</m>, <m>z_2</m>, and <m>z_3</m>,
          onto three distinct points,
          <m>w_1</m>, <m>w_2</m>, and <m>w_3</m>, respectively.
          An implicit formula for the mapping is given by
          <men xml:id="impform">
            \left(\frac{z-z_1}{z-z_3}\right)\!\left(\frac{z_2-z_3}{z_2-z_1}\right) = \left(\frac{w-w_1}{w-w_3}\right)\!\left(\frac{w_2-w_3}{w_2-w_1}\right)
          </men>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We algebraically manipulate Equation <xref ref="impform"/> and solve for <m>w</m> in terms of <m>z</m>.
        The result is an expression for <m>w</m> that has the form of Equation <xref ref="bilineardef"/>,
        where the coefficients <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>,
        and <m>d</m> involve various combinations of the values <m>z_1, \, z_2, \, z_3, \, w_1, \, w_2</m>,
        and <m>w_3</m>.
        The details are left as an exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we set <m>z=z_1</m> and <m>w=w_1</m> in Equation <xref ref="impform"/>, then both sides of the equation are zero,
        showing that <m>w_1</m> is the image of <m>z_1</m>.
        If we set <m>z=z_2</m> and <m>w=w_2</m> in Equation <xref ref="impform"/>,
        then both sides of the equation take on the value <m>1</m>.
        Hence <m>w_2</m> is the image of <m>z_2</m>.
        Taking reciprocals,
        we write Equation <xref ref="impform"/> in the form
        <men xml:id="impformrc">
          \left(\frac{z-z_3}{z-z_1}\right)\!\left(\frac{z_2-z_1}{z_2-z_3}\right) = \left(\frac{w-w_3}{w-w_1}\right)\!\left(\frac{w_2-w_1}{w_2-w_3}\right)
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we set <m>z=z_3</m> and <m>w=w_3</m> in Equation <xref ref="impformrc"/>, then both sides of the equation are zero.
        Therefore <m>w_3</m> is the image of <m>z_3</m>,
        and we have shown that the transformation has the required properties.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Construct the bilinear transformation <m>w=S(z)</m> that maps the points <m>z_1=-i</m>,
          <m>z_2=1</m>,
          and <m>z_3=i</m> onto the points <m>w_1=-1</m>, <m>w_2=0</m>,
          and <m>w_3=1</m>, respectively.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We use the implicit formula (Equation <xref ref="impform"/>) and write
          <me>
            \left(\frac{z+i}{z-i}\right)\!\left(\frac{1-i}{1+i}\right) = \left(\frac{w+1}{w-1}\right)\!\left(\frac{0-1}{0+1}\right) = \frac{w+1}{-w+1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding this equation, we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow>(1+i) zw+(1-i)w \amp +(1+i)z +(1-i)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = (-1+i) zw+(-1-i)w + (1-i)z+(1+i) </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, collecting terms involving <m>w</m> and <m>zw</m> on the left results in
          <me>
            2w+2zw=2i-2iz
          </me>,
          from which we obtain <m>w(1+z) =i(1-z)</m>.
          Therefore the desired bilinear transformation is
          <me>
            w=S(z) =\frac{i(1-z)}{1+z}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the bilinear transformation <m>w=S(z)</m> that maps the points <m>z_1=-2, \, z_2 = -1-i</m>,
          and <m>z_3=0</m> onto <m>w_1=-1, \, w_2=0</m>,
          and <m>w_3=1</m>, respectively.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Again, we use the implicit formula and write
          <me>
            \left(\frac{z-(-2)}{z-0}\right)\!\left(\frac{-1-i-0}{-1-i-(-2)}\right) = \left(\frac{w-(-1)}{w-1}\right)\!\left(\frac{0-1}{0-(-1)}\right)
          </me>.
          Using the fact that <m>\frac{-1-i}{1-i}=\frac{1}{i}</m>,
          we rewrite this equation as
          <me>
            \frac{z+2}{iz}=\frac{1+w}{1-w}
          </me>.
          We now expand the equation and obtain <m>z+2-zw-2w=iz+izw</m>,
          which can be solved for <m>w</m> in terms of <m>z</m>,
          giving the desired solution
          <me>
            w=S(z) =\frac{(1-i) z+2}{(1+i) z+2}
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We let <m>D</m> be a region in the <m>z</m> plane that is bounded by either a circle or a straight line <m>C</m>.
      We further let <m>z_1</m>, <m>z_2</m>,
      and <m>z_3</m> be three distinct points that lie on <m>C</m> and have the property that an observer moving along <m>C</m> from <m>z_1</m> to <m>z_3</m> through <m>z_2</m> finds the region <m>D</m> to be on the left.
      If <m>C</m> is a circle and <m>D</m> is the interior of <m>C</m>,
      then we say that <m>C</m> is positively oriented.
      Conversely, the ordered triple
      <m>(z_1,z_2,z_3)</m> uniquely determines a region that lies to the left of <m>C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We let <m>G</m> be a region in the <m>w</m> plane that is bounded by either a circle of a straight line <m>K</m>.
      We further let <m>w_1</m>, <m>w_2</m>,
      and <m>w_3</m> be three distinct points that lie on <m>K</m> such that an observer moving along <m>K</m> from <m>w_1</m> to <m>w_3</m> through <m>w_2</m> finds the region <m>G</m> to be on the left.
      Because a bilinear transformation is a conformal mapping that maps the class of circles and straight lines onto itself,
      we can use the implicit formula to construct a bilinear transformation <m>w=S(z)</m> that is a one-to-one mapping of <m>D</m> onto <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that the mapping
          <me>
            w=S(z) =\frac{(1-i) z+2}{(1+i) z+2}
          </me>
          maps the disk <m>D:\left\vert z+1\right\vert \lt 1</m> onto the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w)>0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For convenience, we choose the ordered triple <m>z_1=-2</m>,
          <m>z_2=-1-i</m>, and <m>z_3=0</m>,
          which gives the circle <m>C : |z+1|=1</m> a positive orientation and the disk <m>D</m> a left orientation.
          From Example 9.5, the corresponding image points are
          <me>
            w_1=S(z_1) =-1,  w_2 = S(z_2) = 0,  \text{ and }   w_3 = S(z_3) = 1
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the ordered triple of points <m>w_1</m>,
          <m>w_2</m>, and <m>w_3</m> lie on the <m>u</m>-axis,
          it follows that the image of circle <m>C</m> is the <m>u</m>-axis.
          The points <m>w_1</m>, <m>w_2</m>,
          and <m>w_3</m> give the upper half-plane <m>G</m>:
          <m>\mathrm{ Im}(w) >0</m> a left orientation.
          Therefore <m>w=S(z)</m> maps the disk <m>D</m> onto the upper half-plane <m>G</m>.
          To check our work,
          we choose a point <m>z_0</m> that lies in <m>D</m> and find the half-plane in which its image,
          <m>w_0</m>, lies.
          The choice <m>z_0=-1</m> yields <m>w_0=S(-1) =i</m>.
          Hence the upper half-plane is the correct image.
          This situation is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_ch-09-06">Figure</xref>.

          For convenience we choose <m>z_1=4</m>, <m>z_2=2+2i</m>,
          and <m>z_3=0</m> and the image values <m>w_1=0</m>, <m>w_2=1</m>,
          and <m>w_3=\infty</m>, respectively.
          The ordered triple <m>z_1</m>, <m>z_2</m>,
          and <m>z_3</m> gives the circle
          <m>|z-2| =2</m> a positive orientation and the disk
          <m>| z-2| \lt 2</m> has a left orientation.
          The image points <m>w_1</m>, <m>w_2</m>,
          and <m>w_3</m> all lie on the extended <m>u</m>-axis,
          and they determine a left orientation for the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) >0</m>.
          Therefore we can use the second implicit formula given in Equation <xref ref="impforminf"/> to write
          <me>
            \left(\frac{z-4}{z-0}\right)\!\left(\frac{2+2i-0}{2+2i-4}\right)=\frac{w-0}{1-0}
          </me>,
          which determines a mapping of the disk
          <m>|z-2| \lt 2</m> onto the upper half-plane <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) >0</m>.
          We simplify the preceding equation to obtain the desired solution:
          <me>
            w = S(z) = \frac{-iz+4i}{z}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          A straightforward calculation shows that the points <m>z_4=1-i, \, z_5=2</m>,
          and <m>z_6=1+i</m> are mapped onto the points
          <me>
            w_4 = S(1-i) = -2+i,  w_5 = S(2) =,  \text{ and }   w_6 = S(1+i) = 2+i
          </me>,
          respectively.
          The points <m>w_4, \, w_5</m>,
          and <m>w_6</m> lie on the horizontal line
          <m>\mathrm{Im}(w) =1</m> in the upper half-plane.
          Therefore the crescent-shaped region is mapped onto the horizontal strip <m>0 \lt  \mathrm{Im}(w) \lt  1</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-09-07">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Lines of Flux</title>
    <p>
      In electronics,
      images of certain lines represent lines of electric flux,
      which comprise the trajectory of an electron placed in an electrical field.
      Consider the bilinear transformation
      <me>
        w = S(z) = \frac{z}{z-a}  \text{ and }   z = S^{-1}(w) = \frac{aw}{w-1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The half rays <m>\{\mathrm{Arg}(w)=c\}</m>,
      where <m>c</m> is a constant,
      that meet at the origin <m>w=0</m> represent the lines of electric flux produced by a source located at <m>w=0</m>
      (and a sink at <m>w=\infty</m>).
      The preimage of this family of lines is a family of circles that pass through the points <m>z=0</m> and <m>z=a</m>.
      We visualize these circles as the lines of electric flux from one point charge to another.
      The limiting case as <m>a\to 0</m> is called a dipole.
      The graphs for <m>a=1, \, a=0.5</m>,
      and <m>a=0.1</m> are shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-09-08">Figure</xref>.
