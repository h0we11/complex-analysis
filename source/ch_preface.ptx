  <title>Preface</title>
  <p>
    <em>Approach</em>   After six editions of publishing with Jones and Bartlett Learning we are delighted that we can now make this text available as an open-source document,
    and have designed it for students in mathematics,
    physics, and engineering at the undergraduate level.
    Our goal is to illustrate the theoretical concepts and proofs with practical applications,
    and to present them in a style that is enjoyable for students to read.
    We believe both mathematicians and scientists should be exposed to a careful presentation of mathematics.
    Our use of the term
    <q>careful</q>
    here means paying attention to such things as ensuring required assumptions are met before using a theorem,
    checking that algebraic operations are valid,
    and confirming that formulas have not been blindly applied.
    We do not mean to equate care with rigor,
    as we present our proofs in a self-contained manner that is understandable by students having studied multivariable calculus.
    For example,
    we include Green's theorem and use it to prove the Cauchy-Goursat theorem,
    although we also include the proof by Goursat.
    Depending on the level of rigor desired,
    students may look at one or the other<mdash/>or both.

    We aim to give sufficient applications to motivate and illustrate how complex analysis is used in applied fields.
    Computer graphics help show that complex analysis is a computational tool of practical value.
    The exercise sets offer a wide variety of choices for computational skills,
    theoretical understanding,
    and applications that were class tested for six editions of the text when it was available for purchase (\ie,
    prior to this free open-source edition).
    We provide answers to most odd-numbered problems.
    For those problems that require proofs,
    we attempt to model what a good proof should look like,
    often guiding students up to a point and then asking them to fill in the details.
  </p>

    The purpose of the first six chapters is to lay the foundation for the study of complex analysis and develop the topics of analytic and harmonic functions,
    the elementary functions, and contour integration.
    <xref ref="ch_taylor-laurent">Chapters</xref>
    and <xref ref="ch_residue"></xref>,
    dealing with residue calculus and applications,
    may be skipped if there is more interest in conformal mapping and applications of harmonic functions,
    which are the topics of <xref ref="ch_conformal-mapping">Chapters</xref>
    and <xref ref="ch_harmonic-apps"></xref> respectively.
    For courses requiring even more applications,
    <xref ref="ch_fs-laplace">Chapter</xref>
    investigates Fourier and Laplace transforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Features</em> The answers to most odd-numbered exercises should help instructors as they deliberate on problem assignments,
    and should help students as they review material.
    We present conformal mapping in a visual and geometric manner so that compositions and images of curves and regions can be more easily understood.
    We first solve boundary value problems for harmonic functions in the upper half-plane so that we can use conformal mapping by elementary functions to obtain solutions in other domains.
    We carefully develop the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and present applications.
    We use two-dimensional mathematical models for applications in the areas of ideal fluid flow,
    steady-state temperatures, and electrostatics.
    We accurately portray streamlines, isothermals,
    and equipotential curves with computer-drawn figures.
  </p>
  <p>
    An early introduction to sequences and series appears in <xref ref="ch_seq-series-fractals">Chapter</xref>,
    which facilitates the definition of the exponential function via series.
    The section on Julia and Mandelbrot sets illustrates how complex analysis connects with contemporary topics in mathematics.
    Included are computer-generated illustrations such as Riemann surfaces,
    contour and surface graphics for harmonic functions, the Dirichlet problem,
    streamlines involving harmonic and analytic functions,
    and conformal mapping.
    We also have a section on the Joukowski airfoil.
