  <title>The Joukowski Airfoil</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Russian scientist N.<nbsp/>E.<nbsp/>Joukowski studied the function
      <me>
        J(z) = z + \frac{1}{z}
      </me>.
      He showed that the image of a circle passing through <m>z_1=1</m> and containing the point <m>z_2=-1</m> is mapped onto a curve shaped like the cross section of an airplane wing.
      We call this curve the <em>Joukowski airfoil</em>.
      If the streamlines for a flow around the circle are known,
      then their images under the mapping <m>w=J(z)</m> will be streamlines for a flow around the Joukowski airfoil,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-060">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-060">
      <caption>Image of a fluid flow under <m>w=J(z) =z+\frac{1}{z}</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-10/ch-10-fig-060.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The mapping <m>w=J(z)</m> is two-to-one,
      because <m>J(z) =J(\frac{1}{z})</m>, for <m>z\ne 0</m>.
      The region <m>|z|>1</m> is mapped one-to-one onto the <m>w</m> plane slit along the portion of the real axis <m>-2 \le u \le 2</m>.
      To visualize this mapping,
      we investigate the implicit form,
      which we obtain by using the substitutions
      <md>
        <mrow>w-2 \amp = z-2+\frac{1}{z} = \frac{z^2-2z+1}{z} = \frac{(z-1)^2}{z},  \text{ and }</mrow>
        <mrow>w+2 \amp = z+2+\frac{1}{z} = \frac{z^2+2z+1}{z} = \frac{(z+1)^2}{z}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forming the quotient of these two quantities results in the relationship
      <me>
        \frac{w-2}{w+2} = \left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)^{\!2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The inverse of <m>T(w) =\frac{w-2}{w+2}</m> is <m>S_3(z) = \frac{2+2z}{1-z}</m>.
      If we use the notation <m>S_1(z) = \frac{z-1}{z+1}</m> and <m>S_2(z)=z^2</m>,
      then we can express <m>J(z)</m> as the composition of <m>S_1, \, S_2</m>,
      and <m>S_3</m>:
      <men xml:id="composition">
        w = J(z) = S_3\Big(S_2\big(S_1(z)\big)\Big)
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can easily show that <m>w=J(z) =z+\frac{1}{z}</m> maps the four points <m>z_1=-i, \, z_2=1, \, z_3=i</m>,
      and <m>z_4=-1</m> onto <m>w_1=0</m>,
      <m>w_2=2</m>, <m>w_3=0</m>, and <m>w_4=-2</m>, respectively.
      However, the composition functions in Equation <xref ref="composition"/> must be considered in order to visualize the geometry involved.
      First, the bilinear transformation
      <m>Z=S_1(z)</m> maps the region <m>|z|>1</m> onto the right half-plane <m>\mathrm{Re}(Z)>0</m>,
      and the points <m>z_1=-i, \, z_2=1, \, z_3=i</m>,
      and <m>z_4=-1</m> are mapped onto <m>Z_1=-i, \, Z_2=0, \, Z_3=i</m>,
      and <m>Z_4=i\infty</m>, respectively.
      Second, the function <m>W=S_2(Z)</m> maps the right half plane onto the <m>W</m> plane slit along its negative real axis,
      and the points <m>Z_1=-i, \, Z_2=0, \, Z_3=i</m>, and <m>Z_4=i\infty</m>,
      are mapped onto <m>W_1=-1, \, W_2=0, \, W_3=-1</m>,and <m>W_4=-\infty</m>,
      respectively.
      Then the bilinear transformation
      <m>w=S_3(W)</m> maps the latter region onto the <m>w</m> plane slit along the portion of the real axis <m>-2 \le u \le 2</m>,
      and the points <m>W_1=-1, \, W_2=0, \, W_3=-1</m>,
      and <m>W_4=-\infty</m> are mapped onto <m>w_1=0, \, w_2=2, \, w_3=0</m>,
      and <m>w_4=-2</m>, respectively.
      These three compositions are shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-061">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-061">
      <caption>The composition mappings for <m>J(z) =S_3\Big(S_2\big(S_1(z)\big)\Big)</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-10/ch-10-fig-061.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The circle <m>C_0</m> with center <m>c_0=ia</m> on the imaginary axis passes through the points <m>z_2=1</m> and <m>z_4=-1</m> and has radius <m>r_0=\sqrt{1+a^2}</m>.
      With the restriction that <m>0\lt a\lt 1</m>,
      then this circle intersects the <m>x</m> axis at the point <m>z_2</m> with angle <m>\alpha_0=\frac{\pi}{2}- \mathrm{Arctan}(a)</m>,
      with <m>\frac{\pi}{4}\lt \alpha_0\lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
      We want to track the image of <m>C_0</m> in the <m>Z, \, W</m>,
      and <m>w</m> planes.
      First, the image of this circle <m>C_0</m> under
      <m>Z=S_1(z)</m> is the line <m>L_0</m> that passes through the origin and is inclined at the angle <m>\alpha_0</m>.
      Second, the function <m>W=S_2(Z)</m> maps the line <m>L_0</m> onto the ray <m>R_0</m> inclined at the angle <m>2\alpha_0</m>.
      Finally, the transformation given by
      <m>w=S_3(W)</m> maps the ray <m>R_0</m> onto the arc of the circle <m>A_0</m> that passes through the points <m>w_2=2</m> and <m>w_4=-2</m> and intersects the <m>x</m> axis at <m>w_2</m> with angle <m>2\alpha_0</m>,
      where <m>\frac{\pi}{2} \lt 2\alpha_0 \lt \pi</m>.
      The restriction on the angle <m>\alpha_0</m>,
      and hence <m>2\alpha_0</m>,
      is necessary in order for the arc <m>A_0</m> to have a low profile.
      The arc <m>A_0</m> lies in the center of the Joukowski airfoil and is shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-062">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-062">
      <caption>The images of the circles <m>C_0</m> and <m>C_1</m> under the mapping <m>J(z) =S_3\Big(S_2\big(S_1(z)\big)\Big)</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-10/ch-10-fig-062.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If we let <m>b</m> be fixed, <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m>,
      then the larger circle <m>C_1</m> with center given by
      <m>c_1=-h+i(1+h) b</m> on the imaginary axis will pass through the points <m>z_2=1</m> and
      <m>z_4=-1-2h</m> and have radius <m>r_1=(1+h)\sqrt{1+b^2}</m>.
      The circle <m>C_1</m> also intersects the <m>x</m> axis at the point <m>z_2</m> at the angle <m>\alpha_0</m>.
      The image of circle <m>C_1</m> under
      <m>Z=S_1(z)</m> is the circle <m>K_1</m>,
      which is tangent to <m>L_0</m> at the origin.
      The function <m>W=S_2(Z)</m> maps the circle <m>K_1</m> onto the cardioid <m>H_1</m>.
      Finally, <m>w=S_3(W)</m> maps the cardioid <m>H_1</m> onto the Joukowski airfoil <m>A_1</m> that passes through the point <m>w_2=2</m> and surrounds the point <m>w_4=-2</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-062">Figure</xref>.
      An observer traversing <m>C_1</m> counterclockwise will traverse the image curves <m>K_1</m> and <m>H_1</m> clockwise but will traverse <m>A_1</m> counterclockwise.
      Thus the points <m>z_4, \, Z_4, \, W_4</m>,
      and <m>w_4</m> will always be to the observer's left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are ready to visualize the flow around the Joukowski airfoil.
      We start with the fluid flow around a circle
      (see <xref ref="fig_ch-10-051">Figure</xref>).
      This flow is adjusted with a linear transformation
      <m>z^*=az+b</m> so that it flows horizontally around the circle <m>C_1</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-063">Figure</xref>.
      Then the mapping <m>w=J(z^*)</m> creates a flow around the Joukowski airfoil,
      per <xref ref="fig_ch-10-064">Figure</xref>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_flow-with-circulation">
    <title>Flow with Circulation</title>
    <p>
      The function <m>F(z) =sz+\frac{s}{z}+\frac{k}{2\pi i}\mathrm{Log}(z)</m> , where <m>s>0</m> and <m>k</m> is real,
      is the complex potential for a uniform horizontal flow past the unit circle <m>|z|=1</m>,
      with circulation strength <m>k</m> and velocity at infinity <m>V_{\infty}=s</m>.
      For illustrative purposes,
      we let <m>s=1</m> and use the substitution <m>a=\frac{-k}{2\pi}</m>.
      Now the complex potential has the form
      <men xml:id="comppot2">
        F(z) = z + \frac{1}{z}+ai\mathrm{Log}(z)
      </men>,
      and the corresponding velocity function is
      <me>
        V(x,y) = \overline{F,'(z)} = 1 - (\overline{z})^{-2} - ai(\overline{z})^{-1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can express the complex potential in <m>F=\phi +i\psi</m> form:
      <md>
        <mrow>F(z)  \amp = re^{i\theta}+\frac{1}{r}e^{i\theta}+ia(\ln r+i\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \left(r+\frac{1}{r}\right)\cos\theta - a\theta + i\left[\left(r-\frac{1}{r}\right)\sin\theta + a\ln r\right] </mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the flow given by <m>\psi =c</m>,
      where <m>c</m> is a constant, we have
      <me>
        \psi(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) = \left(r-\frac{1}{r}\right)\sin\theta + a\ln r = c. \;\; \text{ (Streamlines) }
      </me>.
      Setting <m>r=1</m> in this equation,
      we get <m>\psi(\cos\theta, \sin\theta) = 0</m> for all <m>\theta</m>,
      so the unit circle is a natural boundary curve for the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Points at which the flow has zero velocity are called
      <em>stagnation points</em>.
      To find them we solve <m>F,'(z) =0</m>: For the function in <xref ref="comppot2">Equation</xref>
      we have <m>1 - \frac{1}{z^2} + \frac{a}{z} = 0</m>.
      Multiplying through by <m>z^2</m> and rearranging terms gives <m>z^2 + aiz - 1 = 0</m>.
      Now we invoke the quadratic equation to obtain
      <me>
        z = \frac{-ai\pm \sqrt{4-z^2}}{2}  \text{ \big(Stagnation point(s)\big). }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>0 \le |a| \lt 2</m>,
      then there are two stagnation points on the unit circle <m>|z|=1</m>.
      If <m>a=2</m>,
      then there is one stagnation point on the unit circle.
      If <m>|a|>2</m>,
      then the stagnation point lies outside the unit circle.
      We are mostly interested in the case with two stagnation points.
      When <m>a=0</m>, the two stagnation points are <m>z = \pm 1</m>,
      which is the flow discussed in <xref ref="ex_10_25">Example</xref>.
      The cases <m>a=1, \, a=\sqrt{3}, \, a=2</m>,
      and <m>a=2.2</m> are shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-065">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-065">
      <caption>Flows past the unit circle with circulation <m>a</m></caption>
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-10/ch-10-fig-065.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We are now ready to combine the preceding ideas.
      For illustrative purposes,
      we consider a <m>C_1</m> circle with center
      <m>c_0 = -0.15 + 0.23i</m> that passes through the points <m>z_2=1</m> and
      <m>z_4=-1.3</m> and has radius <m>r_0=0.23 \sqrt{\frac{13}{2}}</m>.
      We use the linear transformation
      <m>Z=S(z) =-0.15+0.23i+r_0z</m> to map the flow with circulation <m>k=-0.52p</m>
      (or <m>a=0.26</m>)
      around <m>|z|=1</m> onto the flow around the circle <m>C_1</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-066">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-066">
      <caption>Flow around <m>C_1</m></caption>

    <figure xml:id="fig_ch-10-067">
      <caption>Flow around a Joukowski airfoil</caption>
      {0.5\textwidth}
      <image width="73%" source="figs/ch-10/ch-10-fig-067.svg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Then we use the mapping <m>w = J(Z) = Z + \frac{1}{Z}</m> to map this flow around the Joukowski airfoil,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-067">Figure</xref>
      and compare it to the flows shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-063">Figures</xref>
      and <xref ref="fig_ch-10-064"></xref>.
      If the second transformation in the composition given by
      <m>w = J(z) = S_3\Big(S_2\big(S_1(z)\big)\Big)</m> is modified to be <m>S_2(z) =z^{1.925}</m>,
      then the image of the flow shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-066">Figure</xref>
      will be the flow around the modified airfoil shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-068">Figure</xref>.
      The advantage of this latter airfoil is that the sides of its tailing edge form an angle of 0.15<m>\pi</m> radians,
      or <m>27^\circ</m>,
      which is more realistic than the angle of <m>0^\circ</m> of the traditional Joukowski airfoil.
