  <title>Julia and Mandelbrot Sets</title>
  <p>
    An impetus for studying complex analysis is the comparison of properties of real numbers and functions with their complex counterparts.
    In this section we take a look at Newton's method for finding solutions to the equation <m>f(z)=0</m>.
    Then, by examining the more general topic of iteration,
    we will plunge into a breathtaking world of color and imagination.
    The mathematics surrounding this topic has generated a great deal of popular attention in the past few years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall from calculus that Newton's method proceeds by starting with a function <m>f(x)</m> and an initial
    <q>guess</q>
    of <m>x_0</m> as a solution to <m>f(x)=0</m>.
    We then generate a new guess <m>x_1</m> by the computation <m>x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f\,'(x_0)}</m>.
    Using <m>x_1</m> in place of <m>x_0</m>, this process is repeated,
    giving <m>x_2=x_1-\frac{{f\,(x_1)}}{{f\,'(x_1)}}</m>.
    We thus obtain a sequence of points <m>\{x_k\}</m>,
    where <m>x_{k+1}=x_k-\frac{{f(x_k)}}{{\ f\,'(x_k)}}</m>.
    The points <m>\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}</m> are called the iterates of <m>x_0</m>.
    For functions defined on the real numbers,
    this method gives remarkably good results,
    and the sequence <m>\{x_k\}</m> often converges to a solution of <m>f(x) =0</m> rather quickly.
    In the late 1800s, the British mathematician Arthur Cayley investigated the question of whether Newton's method can be applied to complex functions.
    He wrote a paper giving an analysis for how this method works for quadratic polynomials and indicated his intention to publish a subsequent paper for cubic polynomials.
    Unfortunately, Cayley died before producing this paper.
    As you will see,
    the extension of Newton's method to the complex domain and the more general question of iteration are quite complicated.

    The complex version of Newton's method also appears to work quite well.
    Recall, however, that with functions defined on the reals,
    not every initial guess produces a sequence that converges to a solution.
    <xref ref="ex_4_8">Example</xref>
    shows that the same is true in the complex case.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex_4_8">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that Newton's method fails for the function
        <m>f(z)=z^2+1</m> if the initial guess is a real number.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        From <xref ref="Newton_s_Method_Ex">Example</xref> we know that,
        for any guess <m>z</m> as a solution of <m>z^2+1=0</m>,
        the next guess at a solution is <m>N(z) =z-\frac{f(z)}{f\,'(z)}=\frac{z^2-1}{2z}</m>.
        We let <m>z_0</m> be any real number and <m>\{z_k\}</m> be the sequence of iterations produced by the initial seed <m>z_0</m>.
        If for any <m>k</m>, <m>z_k=0</m>,
        the procedure terminates, as <m>z_{k+1}</m> will be undefined.
        If all the terms of the sequence <m>\{z_k\}</m> are defined,
        an easy induction argument shows that all the terms of the sequence are real.
        Because the solutions of <m>z^2+1=0</m> are <m>\pm i</m>,
        the sequence <m>\{z_k\}</m> cannot possibly converge to either solution.
        In the exercises we ask you to explore in detail what happens when <m>z_0</m> is in the upper or lower half-plane.

    The case for cubic polynomials is more complicated than that for quadratics.
    Fortunately,
    we can get an idea of what's going on by doing some experimentation with computer graphics.
    We begin with the cubic polynomial <m>f(z) =z^3+1</m>.
    (Recall that the roots of this polynomial are at <m>-1, \, \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i</m>,
    and <m>\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i</m>.)
    We associate a color with each root
    (blue, red, and green, respectively).
    We form a rectangular region <m>R</m>,
    which contains the three roots of <m>f(z)</m>,
    and partition this region into equal rectangles <m>R_{ij}</m>.
    We then choose a point <m>z_{ij}</m> at the center of each rectangle, and for each of these points apply the following algorithm:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          With <m>N(z) =z-\frac{f(z)} {f\,'(z)}</m>, compute <m>N(z_{ij})</m>.
          Continue computing successive iterates of this initial point until we either are within a certain preassigned tolerance (say,
          <m>\varepsilon</m>) of one of the roots of <m>f(z)=0</m>,
          or until the number of iterations has exceeded a preassigned maximum.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If Step 1 leaves us within
          <m>\varepsilon</m> of one of the roots of <m>f(z)</m>,
          we color the entire rectangle <m>R_{ij}</m> with the color associated with that root.
          Otherwise, we assume that the initial point <m>z_{ij}</m> does not converge to any root,
          and we color the entire rectangle yellow.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this algorithm doesn't prove anything.
    In Step 2, there is no a priori reason to justify the assumption mentioned,
    nor is there any necessity for an initial point <m>z_{ij}</m> to have its sequence of iterates converging to one of the roots of <m>f(z) =0</m> just because a particular iteration is within <m>\varepsilon</m> of that root.
    Finally, the fact that one point in a rectangle behaves in a certain way does not imply that all the points in that rectangle behave in a like manner.
    Nevertheless,
    we can use this algorithm as a basis for mathematical explorations.
    Indeed, computer experiments such as the one described have contributed to a lot of exciting mathematics during the past 30 years.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-1">Figure</xref>
    shows the results for the cubic polynomial <m>f(z)=z^3+1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The points in the blue, red, and green regions are those
    <q>initial guesses</q>
    that will converge to the roots <m>-1</m>,
    <m>\frac{1}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i</m>,
    and <m>\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i</m>, respectively.
    (The roots themselves are located in the middle of the three largest colored regions.)
    The complexity of this picture becomes apparent when you observe that,
    wherever two colors appear to meet,
    the third color emerges between them.
    But then, a closer inspection of the area where this third color meets one of the other colors reveals again a different color between them.
    This process continues with an infinite complexity.

    There appear to be no yellow regions with any area in <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-1">Figure</xref>,
    indicating that at least most initial guesses <m>z_0</m> at a solution to <m>z^3+1=0</m> will produce a sequence <m>\{z_k\}</m> that converges to one of the three roots.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-2">Figure</xref>
    demonstrates that this outcome does not always occur.

    The yellow area shown is often referred to as the <em>rabbit</em>.
    It consists of a main body and two ears,
    and is an example of a <em>fractal image</em>.
    Mathematicians use the term fractal to indicate an object that is self-similar and infinitely replicating.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-3">Figure</xref>
    illustrates this phenomenon by zooming in on a portion of <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-2">Figure</xref>.

    In 1918, the French mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou noticed this fractal phenomenon when exploring iterations of functions not necessarily connected with Newton's method.
    Beginning with a function <m>f(z)</m> and a point <m>z_0</m>,
    they computed the iterates
    <me>
      z_1=f(z_0), \, z_2=f(z_1), \, \ldots, \, z_{k+1}=f(z_k), \ldots
    </me>
    and investigated properties of the sequence <m>\{z_k\}</m>.
    Their findings did not receive a great deal of attention,
    largely because computer graphics were not available at that time.
    With the recent proliferation of computers,
    it is not surprising that these investigations were revived in the 1980s.
    Detailed studies of Newton's method and the more general topic of iteration were undertaken by a host of mathematicians including Curry, Devaney, Douady, Garnett, Hubbard, Mandelbrot, Milnor,
    and Sullivan.
    We now turn our attention to some of their results by focusing on the iterations produced by quadratics of the form <m>f_c(z) =z^2+c</m>.
    You will be surprised at the startling pictures that graphical iterates of such a simple function produce.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>f_c(z) =z^2+c</m>,
        analyze all possible iterations when <m>c=0</m>, that is,
        for the function <m>f_0</m> defined by <m>f_0(z) =z^2+0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We leave as an exercise the claim that,
        if <m>|z_0|\lt 1</m>, the sequence will converge to 0;
        if <m>|z_0|>1</m>, the sequence will be unbounded;
        and if <m>|z_0|=1</m>,
        the sequence will either oscillate around the unit circle or converge to 1.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    For the function <m>f_c</m>,
    defined by <m>f_c(z) =z^2+c</m>,
    and an initial seed <m>z_0</m>,
    the set of iterates given by
    <m>z_1=f_c(z_0)</m>, <m>z_2=f_c(z_1)</m>,
    <ellipsis/> is also called the orbit of <m>z_0</m> generated by <m>f_c</m>.
    We let <m>K_c</m> denote the set of points with a bounded orbit for <m>f_c</m>.
    Example 4.9 shows that <m>K_0</m> is the closed unit disk <m>\overline{D}_1(0)</m>.
    The boundary of <m>K_c</m> is known as the <em>Julia set</em>
    for the function <m>f_c</m>.
    Thus the Julia set for <m>f_0</m> is the unit circle <m>C_1(0)</m>.
    It turns out that <m>K_c</m> is a nice simple set only when <m>c=0</m> or <m>c=-2</m>;
    otherwise, <m>K_c</m> is fractal.
    <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-4">Figure</xref> shows <m>K_{-1.25}</m>. Its reflective nature
    has reminded some of St.<nbsp/>Mark's square in Venice when flooding occurs.
    The variation in colors in that figure indicate the length of time it takes for points to become
    <q>sufficiently unbounded</q> according to the following algorithm,
    which uses the same notation as our algorithm for iterations via Newton's method:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Compute <m>f_c(z_{ij})</m>.
          Continue computing successive iterates of this initial point until the absolute value of one of the iterations exceeds a certain bound (say,
          <m>L</m>),
          or until the number of iterations has exceeded a preassigned maximum.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If Step 1 leaves us with an iteration whose absolute value exceeds <m>L</m> , we color the entire rectangle <m>R_{ij}</m> with a color indicating the number of iterations needed before this value was attained
          (the more iterations required, the darker the color).
          Otherwise, we assume that the orbit of the initial point <m>z_{ij}</m> do not diverge to infinity,
          and we color the entire rectangle black.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note, again, that this algorithm doesn't prove anything.
    It merely guides the direction of our efforts to do rigorous mathematics.

    The boundary of this set is different from the boundaries of the other sets we have seen,
    in that it is disconnected.
    Julia and Fatou independently discovered a simple criterion that can be used to tell when the Julia set for <m>f_c</m> is connected or disconnected.
    We state their result, but omit the proof,
    as it is beyond the scope of this text.

  <theorem xml:id="Attracting_Points_Draw">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>z_0</m><nbsp/>is an attracting fixed point for the function <m>f</m>.
        Then there is a disk <m>D_{r}(z_0)</m> about <m>z_0</m> such that the iterates of all the points in
        <m>D_{r}^{\ast }(z_0)</m> are drawn toward <m>z_0</m> in the sense that,
        if <m>z\in D_{r}^*(z_0)</m>, then <m>|f(z) -z_0|\lt |z-z_0|</m>.
        In fact, if <m>z_k</m> is the <m>k</m>th iterate of <m>z\in D_{r}^*(z_0)</m>,
        then <m>\lim\limits_{k \to \infty}z_k = z_0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Because <m>z_0</m> is an attracting point for <m>f</m>,
      we know that <m>|f\,'(z_0)|\lt 1</m>.
      And because <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>z_0</m>,
      we know that for any <m>\varepsilon>0</m> there exists some <m>r>0</m> such that if <m>z\in D_{r}^*(z_0)</m>,
      then <m>|\frac{f(z) -f(z_0)}{z-z_0}-f\,'(z_0) |\lt \varepsilon</m>.
      If we set <m>\varepsilon=1-|\,f\,'(z_0) |</m>,
      then we have for all <m>z</m> in <m>D_{r}^*(z_0)</m> that
      <me>
        \left|\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}\right| - |f\,'(z_0)| \le \left|\frac{f(z) -f(z_0)}{z-z_0}-f\,'(z_0)\right| \lt  1-|f\,'(z_0)|
      </me>,
      which gives <m>\big|\frac{f(z) -f(z_0)}{z-z_0}\big|\lt 1</m>.
      Thus <m>|f(z) -f(z_0)| \lt  |z-z_0|</m>.
      Because <m>z_0</m> is a fixed point for <m>f</m>,
      this last inequality implies that <m>|f(z) -z_0| \lt  | z-z_0|</m>,
      which is the first part of our theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof that <m>\lim\limits_{k \to \infty}z_k = z_0</m> is left as an exercise.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    In 1905, Fatou showed that,
    if the function <m>f_c</m> defined by
    <m>f_c(z) =z^2+c</m> has attracting fixed points,
    then the orbit of 0 determined by <m>f_c</m> must converge to one of them.
    Because a convergent sequence is bounded,
    this condition implies that <m>c</m> must belong to <m>M</m>.
    In the exercises we ask you to show that the main cardioid-shaped body of <m>M</m> in <xref ref="fig_ch-04-cp-6">Figure</xref>
    is composed of those points <m>c</m> for which <m>f_c</m> has attracting fixed points.
    You will find <xref ref="Attracting_Thm">Theorem</xref>
    to be a useful characterization of these points.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="Attracting_Thm">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f_c(z) = z^2+c</m> has attracting fixed points iff
        <m>|1+\sqrt{1-4c}|\lt 1</m> or <m>|1-\sqrt{1-4c}| \lt 1</m>,
        where the square root designates the principal square root function.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The point <m>z_0</m> is a fixed point for <m>f_c</m> iff <m>f_c(z_0)=z_0</m>.
      In other words, iff <m>z_0^2-z_0+c = 0</m>.
      By <xref ref="Quadratic_Formula">Theorem</xref>,
      the solutions to this equation are
      <me>
        z_0 = \frac{1+\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}  \text{ or }   z_0 = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}
      </me>,
      where again the square root designates the principal square root function.
      Now, <m>z_0</m> is an attracting point iff <m>|f\,_c'(z_0)| = |2z_0| \lt  1</m>.
      Combining this result with the solutions for <m>z_0</m> gives our desired result.

      <solution>
        <p>
          If we let <m>c=-\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{3}i</m>,
          then <m>\Big|1-\sqrt{1-4c}\Big|=\Big|1-\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}i}\Big|=\Big|1-\big(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sqrt{3}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\big)\Big|</m>
          (show the details for this conclusion).
          But this last quantity equals
          <m>\sqrt{3-\sqrt{6}}</m> (explain), which is less than 1
          (again, explain).

          Prove that <m>\lim_{k \to \infty}z_k=z_0</m> in <xref ref="Attracting_Points_Draw">Theorem</xref>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since <m>|f\,'(z_0) |\lt 1</m>,
          we can choose <m>\rho</m> such that <m>|f\,'z_0) |\lt \rho\lt 1</m>.
          Using the same technique as <xref ref="Attracting_Points_Draw">Theorem</xref>,
          show that if <m>z\in D_{r}^{\ast }( z_0)</m>,
          then <m>|f(z) -z_0|\lt \rho |z-z_0|</m>.
          That is, <m>|z_1-z_0| \lt \rho|z-z_0|</m>, where <m>z_1=f(z)</m>.
          An easy induction argument now gives that,
          for all <m>k</m>, <m>|z_k-z_0|\lt \rho^k|z-z_0|</m>,
          where <m>z_k</m> is the <m>k^{th}</m> iterate of <m>z_0</m>.
          Since <m>\rho \lt 1</m>,
          this implies <m>\lim\limits_{k \to \infty}z_k=z_0</m>.
          Show the details.
