  <title>Two-Dimensional Fluid Flow</title>
  <p>
    Suppose that a fluid flows over the complex plane and that the velocity at the point <m>z=x+iy</m> is given by the velocity vector
    <men xml:id="vvector">
      \mathbf{V}(x,y) = p(x,y) +iq(x,y)
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also require that the velocity does not depend on time and the components <m>p(x,y)</m> and <m>q(x,y)</m> have continuous partial derivatives.
    The divergence of the vector field in <xref ref="vvector">Equation</xref> is given by
    <me>
      \mathrm{div}\mathbf{V}(x,y) = p_x(x,y) + q_y(x,y)
    </me>
    and is a measure of the extent to which the velocity field diverges near the point.
    We consider only fluid flows for which the divergence is zero.
    This condition is more precisely characterized by the requirement that the net flow through any simply closed contour be identically zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we consider the flow out of the small rectangle shown in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-047">Figure</xref>,
    then the rate of outward flow equals the line integral of the exterior normal component of
    <m>\mathbf{V}(x,y)</m> taken over the sides of the rectangle.
    The exterior normal component is given by <m>-q</m> on the bottom edge,
    <m>p</m> on the right edge,
    <m>q</m> on the top edge, and <m>-p</m> on the left edge.
    Integrating and setting the resulting net flow to zero yields
    <men xml:id="intflow">
      \int_y^{y+\Delta y}[p(x+\Delta x,t)-p(x,t)]\,dt + \int_x^{x+\Delta x}[q(t,y+\Delta y)-q(t,y )]\,dt=0
    </men>.

  </figure>
  <p>
    Both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are continuously differentiable,
    so the mean value theorem implies that
    <md>
      <mrow xml:id="eqnspq" number="yes">p(x+\Delta x,t) - p(x,t) \amp = p_x(x_1,t) \Delta x,  \text{ and }</mrow>
      <mrow>q(t,y+\Delta y) - q(t,y) \amp = q_y(t,y_2) \Delta y</mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>x\lt x_1\lt x+\Delta x</m> and <m>y\lt y_2\lt y+\Delta y</m>.
    Substitution of the expressions displayed in Equation <xref ref="eqnspq"/> into Equation <xref ref="intflow"/> and subsequently dividing through by <m>\Delta x\ \Delta y</m> results in
    <me>
      \frac{1}{\Delta y}\int_y^{y+\Delta y}p_x(x_1,t)\,dt + \frac{1}{\Delta x}\int_x^{x+\Delta x}q_y(t,y_2)\,dt=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use the mean value theorem for integrals with this equation to show that
    <me>
      p_x(x_1,y_1) + q_y(x_2,y_2) =0
    </me>,
    where <m>y\lt y_1\lt y+\Delta y</m> and <m>x\lt x_2\lt x+\Delta x</m>.
    Letting <m>\Delta x \to 0</m> and
    <m>\Delta y \to 0</m> in this equation yields
    <men xml:id="eqncont">
      p_x(x,y) + q_y(x,y) =0
    </men>,
    which is called the <em>equation of continuity</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The curl of the vector field in <xref ref="vvector">Equation</xref> has magnitude
    <me>
      \big|\mathbf{curl}\,\mathbf{V}(x,y)\big| = q_x(x,y) - p_y(x,y)
    </me>
    and is an indication of how the field swirls in the vicinity of a point.
    Imagine that a
    <q>fluid element</q>
    at the point <m>(x,y)</m> is suddenly frozen and then moves freely in the fluid.
    The fluid element will rotate with an angular velocity given by
    <me>
      \frac{1}{2}q_y(x,y) - \frac{1}{2}p_x(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}\big|\mathbf{curl}\,\mathbf{V}(x,y)\big|
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider only fluid flows for which the curl is zero.
    Such fluid flows are called <em>irrotational.</em>
    This condition is more precisely characterized by requiring that the line integral of the tangential component of
    <m>\mathbf{V}(x,y)</m> along any simply closed contour be identically zero.
    If we consider the rectangle in <xref ref="fig_ch-10-047">Figure</xref>,
    then the tangential component is given by <m>p</m> on the bottom edge,
    <m>q</m> on the right edge,
    <m>-p</m> on the top edge, and <m>-q</m> on the left edge.
    Integrating and equating the resulting
    <em>circulation</em> integral to zero yields
    <me>
      \int_y^{y+\Delta y}[q(x+\Delta x,t) - q(x,t)]\,dt - \int_x^{x+\Delta x}[p(t, y+\Delta y) - p(t,y)]\,dt=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As before, we apply the mean value theorem and divide through by
    <m>\Delta x\ \Delta y</m>, and obtain the equation
    <me>
      \frac{1}{\Delta y}\int_y^{y+\Delta y}q_x(x_1,t)\,dt - \frac{1}{\Delta x}\int_x^{x+\Delta x}p_y(t,y_2)\,dt=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use the mean value for integrals with this equation to deduce that <m>q_x(x_1,y_1) - p_y(x_2, y_2) =0</m>.
    Letting <m>\Delta x \to 0</m> and <m>\Delta y \to 0</m> yields
    <me>
      q_x(x,y) - p_y(x,y) = 0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Equation <xref ref="eqncont"/> and this equation show that the function
    <m>f(z) = p(x,y) - iq(x,y)</m> satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and is an analytic function.
    If we let <m>F(z)</m> denote the antiderivative of <m>f(z)</m>, then
    <men xml:id="comppot">
      F(z) = \phi(x,y) +i\psi(x,y)
    </men>,
    which is the complex potential of the flow and has the property
    <me>
      \overline{F,'(z)} = \phi_x(x,y) - i\psi_x(x,y) = p(x,y) + iq(x,y) = \mathbf{V}(x,y)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <m>\phi_x=p</m> and <m>\phi_y=q</m>, we also have
    <me>
      \nabla \phi(x,y) = p(x,y) + iq(x,y) = \mathbf{V}(x,y)
    </me>,
    so <m>\phi(x,y)</m> is the velocity potential for the flow,
    and the curves
    <me>
      \phi(x,y) = K_1
    </me>
    are called equipotentials.
    The function <m>\psi(x,y)</m> is called the stream function.
    The curves
    <me>
      \psi(x,y) = K_2
    </me>
    are called streamlines and describe the paths of the fluid particles.
    To demonstrate this result,
    we implicitly differentiate
    <m>\psi(x,y)=K_2</m> and find that the slope of a vector tangent is given by
    <me>
      \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\psi_x(x,y)}{\psi_y(x,y)}
    </me>.
    Using the fact that <m>\psi_y=\phi_x</m> and this equation,
    we find that the tangent vector to the curve is
    <me>
      \mathbf{T} = \phi_x(x,y) - i\psi_x(x,y) = p(x,y) + iq(x,y) = \mathbf{V}(x,y)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The salient idea of the preceding discussion is the conclusion that, if
    <men xml:id="complexpot">
      F(z) = \phi(x,y) + i\psi(x,y)
    </men>
    is an analytic function, then the family of curves
    <me>
      \{\psi(x,y) = K_2\}
    </me>
    represents the streamlines of a fluid flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boundary condition for an ideal fluid flow is that
    <m>\mathbf{V}</m> should be parallel to the boundary curve containing the fluid
    (the fluid flows parallel to the walls of a containing vessel).
    In other words, if <xref ref="complexpot">Equation</xref>
    is the complex potential for the flow,
    then the boundary curve must be given by
    <m>\psi(x,y) =K</m> for some constant <m>K</m>;
    that is, the boundary curve must be a streamline.

        Let
        <me>
          F_1(w) = \Phi(u,v) + i\Psi(u,v)
        </me>
        denote the complex potential for a fluid flow in a domain <m>G</m> in the <m>w</m> plane,
        where the velocity is

          \mathbf{V}_1(u,v) = \overline{F_1,'(w)}

        then the composite function

          \mathbf{V}_2(x,y) = \overline{F_2,'(z)}

  <proof>
    <p>
      From Equation <xref ref="comppot"/>, <m>F_1(w)</m> is an analytic function.
      Since the composition of analytic functions is analytic,
      <m>F_2(z)</m> is the required complex potential for an ideal fluid flow in <m>D</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    We note that the functions
    <me>
      \phi(x,y) = \Phi\big(u(x,y), \, v(x,y)\big)  \text{ and }   \psi(x,y) = \Psi\big(u(x,y), \, v(x,y)\big)
    </me>
    are the new velocity potential and stream function,
    respectively, for the flow in <m>D</m>.
    A streamline or natural boundary curve
    <me>
      \psi(x,y)=K
    </me>
    in the <m>z</m> plane is mapped onto a streamline or natural boundary curve
    <me>
      \Psi(u,v)=K
    </me>
    in the <m>w</m> plane by the transformation <m>w=S(z)</m>.
    One method for finding a flow inside a domain <m>D</m> in the <m>z</m> plane is to conformally map <m>D</m> onto a domain <m>G</m> in the <m>w</m> plane in which the flow is known.
  </p>
  <p>
    For an ideal fluid with uniform density <m>\rho</m>,
    the fluid pressure <m>P(x,y)</m> and speed
    <m>|\mathbf{V}(x,y)|</m> are related by the following special case of Bernoulli's equation:
    <me>
      \frac{P(x,y)}{\rho }+\frac{1}{2}\Big|\mathbf{V}(x,y)\Big| = \text{ constant }
    </me>.
    Note that the pressure is greatest when the speed is least.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The complex potential <m>F(z) =(a+ib) z</m> has the velocity potential and stream function of
        <me>
          \phi(x,y) = ax-by  \text{ and }   \psi(x,y) = bx+ay
        </me>,
        respectively,

        We use the fact that the conformal mapping <m>w=S(z) =z+\frac{1}{z})</m> maps the domain

        The complex potential for a uniform horizontal flow parallel to this slit in the <m>w</m> plane is

      </p>
      <p>
        The composite function <m>F_2(z) = F_1(S(z))</m> determines the fluid flow in the domain <m>D</m>,

          F_2(z) = A\left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right)
        </me>,
        where <m>A>0</m>.
        We can use polar coordinates to express <m>F_2(z)</m> as

          F_2(z) = F_2(re^{i\theta}) = A\left(r+\frac{1}{r}\right) \cos \theta +iA\left(r-\frac{1}{r}\right) \sin \theta

        The complex potential for a uniform horizontal flow parallel to the slit in the <m>w</m> plane is given by <m>F_1(w) =Aw</m>,

        The streamlines given by <m>\psi(x,y) =c</m> for the flow in <m>D</m> are obtained by finding the preimage of the streamline
