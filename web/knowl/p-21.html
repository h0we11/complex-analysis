<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\((2+\sqrt{-1})^3 = 2+11\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> we clearly have <span class="process-math">\(2+\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt[3]{2+11\sqrt{-1}}\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, Bombelli showed that <span class="process-math">\(2-\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt[3]{2-11 \sqrt{-1}}\text{,}\)</span> so that</div>

\begin{align}
\sqrt[3]{2+11\sqrt{-1}}+\sqrt[3]{2-11\sqrt{-1}} \amp = (2+\sqrt{-1})+(2-\sqrt{-1})\notag\\

<div class="para">which was a proverbial bombshell. Prior to Bombelli, mathematicians could easily scoff at imaginary numbers when they arose as solutions to quadratic equations. With cubic equations, they no longer had this luxury. That <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> was a correct solution to the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^3-15x-4=0\)</span> was indisputable, as it could be checked easily. However, to arrive at this very real solution, mathematicians had to take a detour through the uncharted territory of “imaginary numbers.” Thus, whatever else might have been said about these numbers (which, today, we call <em class="emphasis">complex numbers</em>), their utility could no longer be ignored.</div>
