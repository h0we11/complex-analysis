<div class="para">Thus, we may move freely between the notations <span class="process-math">\(x+iy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x, y)\text{,}\)</span> depending on which is more convenient for the context in which we are working. Students sometimes wonder whether it matters where the “<span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>” is located in writing a complex number. It does not. Generally, most texts place terms containing an “<span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>” at the end of an expression, and place the “<span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>” before a variable, but after a constant. Thus, we write <span class="process-math">\(x+iy,\, u+iv\text{,}\)</span> etc., but <span class="process-math">\(3+7i, \, 5-6i\)</span> and so forth. Because letters lower in the alphabet generally denote constants, you will usually (but not always) see the expression <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(a+ib\text{.}\)</span> Many authors write quantities like <span class="process-math">\(1+i\sqrt{3}\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(1+\sqrt{3}i\)</span> to make sure the “<span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>” is not mistakenly thought to be inside the square root symbol. Additionally, if there is concern that the “<span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>” might be missed, it is sometimes placed before a lengthy expression, as in <span class="process-math">\(2\cos(-\frac{5\pi}{6}+2n\pi) +i2\sin(-\frac{5\pi}{6}+2n\pi)\text{.}\)</span>
