<div class="para">Consider a spring that resists compression as well as extension, that is suspended vertically from a fixed support, and a body of mass <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> that is attached at the lower end of the spring. We make the assumption that the mass <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is much larger than the mass of the spring so that we can neglect the mass of the spring. If there is no motion then the system is in static equilibrium, as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-11-17.html" title="Figure 11.3.1">FigureÂ 11.3.1</a>. If the mass is pulled down further and released, then it will undergo an oscillatory motion.</div>
