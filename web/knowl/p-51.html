<div class="para">There are, indeed, genuine logical problems associated with complex numbers. For example, with real numbers <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{ab}=\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}\)</span> so long as both sides of the equation are defined. Applying this identity to complex numbers leads to <span class="process-math">\(1=\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{(-1)(-1)}=\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1} = -1\text{.}\)</span> Plausible answers to these problems can be given, however, and you will learn how to resolve this apparent contradiction in <a href="sec_z_n.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.2: The Mappings w=z^n and w=z^{\frac{1}{n}}">Section 2.2</a>. De Morgan’s remark illustrates that many factors are needed to persuade mathematicians to adopt new theories. In this case, as always, a firm logical foundation was crucial, but so, too, was a willingness to modify some ideas concerning certain well-established properties of numbers.</div>
