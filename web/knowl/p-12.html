<div class="para">Cardano did not have at his disposal the power of todayâ€™s algebraic notation, and he tended to think of cubes or squares as geometric objects rather than algebraic quantities. Essentially, however, his solution began by making the substitution <span class="process-math">\(z=x-\frac{a_2}{3}\text{.}\)</span> This move transformed Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Cubic_Equation.html" title="Equation 1.1.1">(1.1.1)</a> into a cubic equation without a squared term, which is called a depressed cubic. To illustrate, begin with <span class="process-math">\(z^3 + 9z^2 + 24z + 20 = 0\)</span> and substitute <span class="process-math">\(z = x - \frac{a_2}{3} = x -\frac{9}{3} = x - 3\text{.}\)</span> The equation then becomes <span class="process-math">\((x-3)^3 +9(x-3)^2 +24(x-3) + 20 = 0\text{,}\)</span> which simplifies to <span class="process-math">\(x^3 -3x + 2 = 0\text{.}\)</span>
