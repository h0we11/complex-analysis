<div class="para">The case for cubic polynomials is more complicated than that for quadratics. Fortunately, we can get an idea of whatâ€™s going on by doing some experimentation with computer graphics. We begin with the cubic polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(z) =z^3+1\text{.}\)</span> (Recall that the roots of this polynomial are at <span class="process-math">\(-1, \, \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\text{.}\)</span>) We associate a color with each root (blue, red, and green, respectively). We form a rectangular region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> which contains the three roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(z)\text{,}\)</span> and partition this region into equal rectangles <span class="process-math">\(R_{ij}\text{.}\)</span> We then choose a point <span class="process-math">\(z_{ij}\)</span> at the center of each rectangle and for each of these points we apply the following algorithm.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">With <span class="process-math">\(N(z) =z-\frac{f(z)} {f\,'(z)}\text{,}\)</span> compute <span class="process-math">\(N(z_{ij})\text{.}\)</span> Continue computing successive iterates of this initial point until we either are within a certain preassigned tolerance (say, <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>) of one of the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(z)=0\text{,}\)</span> or until the number of iterations has exceeded a preassigned maximum.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If Step 1 leaves us within <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> of one of the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(z)\text{,}\)</span> we color the entire rectangle <span class="process-math">\(R_{ij}\)</span> with the color associated with that root. Otherwise, we assume that the initial point <span class="process-math">\(z_{ij}\)</span> does not converge to any root, and we color the entire rectangle yellow.</div></li>
