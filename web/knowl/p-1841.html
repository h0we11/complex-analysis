<div class="para">As the series for the complex hyperbolic sine and cosine agree with the realÂ hyperbolic sine and cosine when <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is real, the remaining complex hyperbolic trigonometric functions likewise agree with their real counterparts. Many other properties are also shared. We state several results without proof, as they follow from the definitions we gave using standard operations, such as the quotient rule for derivatives. We ask you to establish some of these identities in the exercises.</div>
