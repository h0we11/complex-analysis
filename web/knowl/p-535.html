<div class="para">We prove the contrapositive. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> is accumulation point of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> but that <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> does not belong to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> By definition of an accumulation point, every deleted neighborhood, <span class="process-math">\(D_{\varepsilon}^*(z_0)\text{,}\)</span> contains at least one point of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, every (non-deleted) neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(D_{\varepsilon}(z_0)\)</span> also contains at least one point of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> <em class="emphasis">and</em> at least one point not in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> (namely, <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span>). This condition implies that <span class="process-math">\(z_0\text{,}\)</span> which does not belong to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> is a boundary point of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> (Show the details for this last assertion). Thus, the set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not closed.</div>
