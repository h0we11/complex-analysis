<div class="para">A complex function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous iff its real and imaginary parts, <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> are continuous. The proof of this fact is an immediate consequence of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ReC_Limit_Thm.html" title="Theorem 2.3.7">TheoremÂ 2.3.7</a>. Continuity of complex functions is formally the same as that of real functions, and sums, differences, and products of continuous functions are continuous; their quotient is continuous at points where the denominator is not zero. These results are summarized by the following theorems. We leave the proofs as exercises.</div>
