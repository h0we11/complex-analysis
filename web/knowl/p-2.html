<div class="para">We aim to give sufficient applications to motivate and illustrate how complex analysis is used in applied fields. Computer graphics help show that complex analysis is a computational tool of practical value. The exercise sets offer a wide variety of choices for computational skills, theoretical understanding, and applications that were class tested for six editions of the text when it was available for purchase (i.e., prior to this free open-source edition). We provide answers to most odd-numbered problems. For those problems that require proofs, we attempt to model what a good proof should look like, often guiding students up to a point and then asking them to fill in the details.</div>
