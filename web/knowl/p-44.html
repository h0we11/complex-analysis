<div class="para">What is the (angular) displacement of the standard unit vector? Clearly, its displacement is zero radians, as it coincides with the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. Thus, if vectors <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> have displacements of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{,}\)</span> respectively, and vector <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{ab}\text{,}\)</span> then the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span> should be <span class="process-math">\(\alpha + \beta\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/wessel-3_fig.html" title="Figure 1.1.8">Figure 1.1.8</a>. The reason for this assertion is that, with such an arrangement, Wessel’s displacement protocol works out perfectly: the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span> (which is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha + \beta\)</span>) differs from the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> (which is <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span>) by <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{.}\)</span> This is the same amount that the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> (which is <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span>) differs from the displacement of the standard unit vector (which is 0). Likewise, the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{c}\)</span> differs from the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{,}\)</span> which is the same amount that the displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> differs from the displacement of the standard unit vector.</div>
