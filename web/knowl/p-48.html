<div class="para">It should be pointed out that Wessel was not the only mathematician—or even the first—who began thinking of complex numbers as vectors, or, as points in the plane. As early as 1732 the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (pronounced “oiler” ) adopted this view concerning the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> solutions to the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^n-1=0\text{.}\)</span> You will learn shortly that these solutions can be expressed as <span class="process-math">\(\cos \theta + \sqrt{-1}\sin \theta\)</span> for various values of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span> Euler thought of them as being located at the vertices of a regular polygon in the plane. Euler was also the first to use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\text{.}\)</span> Today this notation is still the most popular, although some electrical engineers prefer the symbol <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> instead so that they can use <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> to represent current.</div>
