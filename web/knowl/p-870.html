<div class="para">The beauty of this structure is that it makes this “full square root function” continuous for all <span class="process-math">\(z \ne 0\text{.}\)</span> Normally, the principal square root function would be discontinuous along the negative real axis, as points near <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> but above that axis would get mapped to points close to <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> and points near <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> but below the axis would get mapped to points close to <span class="process-math">\(-i\text{.}\)</span> As <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-02-20.html" title="Figure 2.4.6">Figure 2.4.6</a>(c) indicates, however, between the point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the point <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> the domain switches from the edge of <span class="process-math">\(D_1\)</span> in the upper half-plane to the edge of <span class="process-math">\(D_2\)</span> in the lower half-plane. The corresponding mapped points <span class="process-math">\(A\,'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\,'\)</span> are exactly where they should be. The surface works in such a way that going directly between the edges of <span class="process-math">\(D_1\)</span> in the upper and lower half-planes is impossible (likewise for <span class="process-math">\(D_2\)</span>). Going counter-clockwise, the only way to get from the point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to the point <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> for example, is to follow the path indicated by the arrows in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-02-20.html" title="Figure 2.4.6">Figure 2.4.6</a>(c).</div>
