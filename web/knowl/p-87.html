<div class="para">To perform operations on complex numbers, mathematicians use the notation <span class="process-math">\(x+iy\)</span> and engage in algebraic manipulations, as we did here, rather than apply the complicated-looking definitions we gave for those operations on ordered pairs. This procedure is valid because we used the <span class="process-math">\(x+iy\)</span> notation as a guide for defining the operations in the first place. Remember, though, that the <span class="process-math">\(x+iy\)</span> notation is nothing more than a convenient bookkeeping device for keeping track of how to manipulate ordered pairs. It is the ordered pair algebraic definitions that form the real foundation on which the complex number system is based. In fact, if you were to program a computer to do arithmetic on complex numbers, your program would perform calculations on ordered pairs, using exactly the definitions that we gave.</div>
