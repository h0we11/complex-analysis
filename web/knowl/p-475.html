<div class="para">A set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is called an open set if every point of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is an interior point of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Thus, Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/TopologyEx.html" title="Example 1.6.9">Example 1.6.9</a> shows that <span class="process-math">\(D_1(0)\)</span> is open. A set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is called a closed set if it contains all its boundary points. A set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is said to be a connected set if every pair of points <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_2\)</span> contained in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be joined by a curve that lies entirely in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Roughly speaking, a connected set consists of a “single piece.” The unit disk <span class="process-math">\(D_1(0)=\{z:|z|\lt 1\}\)</span> is a connected open set. We ask you to verify in the exercises that, if <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_2\)</span> lie in <span class="process-math">\(D_1(0)\text{,}\)</span> then the straight-line segment joining them lies entirely in <span class="process-math">\(D_1(0)\text{.}\)</span> The annulus <span class="process-math">\(A=\{z:1\lt |z|\lt 2\}\)</span> is a connected open set because any two points in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can be joined by a curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> that lies entirely in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-01-30.html" title="Figure 1.6.10">Figure 1.6.10</a>.</div>
