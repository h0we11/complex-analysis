<div class="para">Recall from calculus that Newton’s method proceeds by starting with a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and an initial “guess” of <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> as a solution to <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=0\text{.}\)</span> We then generate a new guess <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> by the computation <span class="process-math">\(x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f\,'(x_0)}\text{.}\)</span> Using <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> in place of <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> this process is repeated, giving <span class="process-math">\(x_2=x_1-\frac{{f\,(x_1)}}{{f\,'(x_1)}}\text{.}\)</span> We thus obtain a sequence of points <span class="process-math">\(\{x_k\}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_{k+1}=x_k-\frac{{f(x_k)}}{{\ f\,'(x_k)}}\text{.}\)</span> The points <span class="process-math">\(\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}\)</span> are called the iterates of <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span> For functions defined on the real numbers, this method gives remarkably good results, and the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{x_k\}\)</span> often converges to a solution of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) =0\)</span> rather quickly. In the late 1800s, the British mathematician Arthur Cayley investigated the question of whether Newton’s method can be applied to complex functions. He wrote a paper giving an analysis for how this method works for quadratic polynomials and indicated his intention to publish a subsequent paper for cubic polynomials. Unfortunately, Cayley died before producing this paper. As you will see, the extension of Newton’s method to the complex domain and the more general question of iteration are quite complicated.</div>
