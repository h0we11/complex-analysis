<em class="emphasis">Features</em>: The answers to most odd-numbered exercises should help instructors as they deliberate on problem assignments, and should help students as they review material. We present conformal mapping in a visual and geometric manner so that compositions and images of curves and regions can be more easily understood. We first solve boundary value problems for harmonic functions in the upper half-plane so that we can use conformal mapping by elementary functions to obtain solutions in other domains. We carefully develop the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and present applications. We use two-dimensional mathematical models for applications in the areas of ideal fluid flow, steady-state temperatures, and electrostatics. We accurately portray streamlines, isothermals, and equipotential curves with computer-drawn figures.</div>
