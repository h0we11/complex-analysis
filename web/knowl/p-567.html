<div class="para">The inverse image of a set of points, <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> is the collection of all points in the domain that map into <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> maps <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> onto <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> it is possible for the inverse image of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to be function as well, but the original function must have a special property: a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is said to be one-to-one if it maps distinct points <span class="process-math">\(z_1 \ne z_2\)</span> onto distinct points <span class="process-math">\(f(z_1) \ne f(z_2)\text{.}\)</span> Many times an easy way to prove that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one is to suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(z_1)=f(z_2)\text{,}\)</span> and from this assumption deduce that <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> must equal <span class="process-math">\(z_2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(f(z)=iz\)</span> is one-to-one because if <span class="process-math">\(f(z_1)=f(z_2)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(iz_1=iz_2\text{.}\)</span> Dividing both sides of the last equation by <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(z_1=z_2\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-02-03.html" title="Figure 2.1.9">FigureÂ 2.1.9</a> illustrates the idea of a one-to-one function: distinct points get mapped to distinct points.</div>
