  "body": " Preface  After six editions of publishing with Jones and Bartlett Learning we are delighted that we can now make this text available as an open-source document, and have designed it for students in mathematics, physics, and engineering at the undergraduate level. Our goal is to illustrate the theoretical concepts and proofs with practical applications, and to present them in a style that is enjoyable for students to read. We believe both mathematicians and scientists should be exposed to a careful presentation of mathematics. Our use of the term careful here means paying attention to such things as ensuring required assumptions are met before using a theorem, checking that algebraic operations are valid, and confirming that formulas have not been blindly applied. We do not mean to equate care with rigor, as we present our proofs in a self-contained manner that is understandable by students having studied multivariable calculus. For example, we include Green's theorem and use it to prove the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, although we also include the proof by Goursat. Depending on the level of rigor desired, students may look at one or the other or both.  We aim to give sufficient applications to motivate and illustrate how complex analysis is used in applied fields. Computer graphics help show that complex analysis is a computational tool of practical value. The exercise sets offer a wide variety of choices for computational skills, theoretical understanding, and applications that were class tested for six editions of the text when it was available for purchase (i.e., prior to this free open-source edition). We provide answers to most odd-numbered problems. For those problems that require proofs, we attempt to model what a good proof should look like, often guiding students up to a point and then asking them to fill in the details.  The purpose of the first six chapters is to lay the foundation for the study of complex analysis and develop the topics of analytic and harmonic functions, the elementary functions, and contour integration. Chapters and , dealing with residue calculus and applications, may be skipped if there is more interest in conformal mapping and applications of harmonic functions, which are the topics of Chapters and respectively. For courses requiring even more applications, Chapter investigates Fourier and Laplace transforms.   Features : The answers to most odd-numbered exercises should help instructors as they deliberate on problem assignments, and should help students as they review material. We present conformal mapping in a visual and geometric manner so that compositions and images of curves and regions can be more easily understood. We first solve boundary value problems for harmonic functions in the upper half-plane so that we can use conformal mapping by elementary functions to obtain solutions in other domains. We carefully develop the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and present applications. We use two-dimensional mathematical models for applications in the areas of ideal fluid flow, steady-state temperatures, and electrostatics. We accurately portray streamlines, isothermals, and equipotential curves with computer-drawn figures.  An early introduction to sequences and series appears in Chapter , which facilitates the definition of the exponential function via series. The section on Julia and Mandelbrot sets illustrates how complex analysis connects with contemporary topics in mathematics. Included are computer-generated illustrations such as Riemann surfaces, contour and surface graphics for harmonic functions, the Dirichlet problem, streamlines involving harmonic and analytic functions, and conformal mapping. We also have a section on the Joukowski airfoil.   Acknowledgments : A textbook does not make it to the sixth edition without the support of a long list of colleagues from various institutions.

  "title": "The Origin of Complex Numbers",
  "body": " The Origin of Complex Numbers   Complex analysis can roughly be thought of as the subject that applies the theory of calculus to imaginary numbers. But what exactly are imaginary numbers? Usually, students learn about them in high school with introductory remarks from their teachers along the following lines: We can't take the square root of a negative number. But let's pretend we can and begin by using the symbol . Rules are then learned for doing arithmetic with these numbers. At some level the rules make sense: if , it stands to reason that . However, it is not uncommon for students to wonder whether they are really doing magic rather than mathematics.  If you ever felt that way, congratulate yourself! you are in the company of some of the great mathematicians from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. They also were perplexed by the notion of roots of negative numbers. Our purpose in this section is to highlight some of the episodes in the very colorful history of how thinking about imaginary numbers developed. We intend to show you that, contrary to popular belief, there is really nothing imaginary about imaginary umbers. They are just as real as real numbers.   Our story begins in 1545. In that year, the Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano published Ars Magna ( The Great Art ), a 40-chapter masterpiece in which he gave for the first time a method for solving the general cubic equation .  Cardano did not have at his disposal the power of today's algebraic notation, and he tended to think of cubes or squares as geometric objects rather than algebraic quantities. Essentially, however, his solution began by making the substitution . This move transformed Equation into a cubic equation without a squared term, which is called a depressed cubic. To illustrate, begin with and substitute . The equation then becomes , which simplifies to .  You need not worry about the computational details here, but in general the substitution transforms Equation into , where , and .  If Cardano could get any value of that solved a depressed cubic, he could easily get a corresponding solution to Equation from the identity . Happily, Cardano knew how to solve a depressed cubic. The technique had been communicated to him by Niccolo Fontana who, unfortunately, came to be known as Tartaglia (the stammerer ) due to a speaking disorder that was caused when he was 12 years old. (Evidently, during the Italian wars, French troops sacked his home in Brescia, Italy in 1512, and struck Tartaglia in the face with a saber.) The procedure was also independently discovered some 30 years earlier by Scipione del Ferro of Bologna. Ferro and Tartaglia showed that one of the solutions to Equation is   Although Cardano would not have reasoned in the following way, today we can take this value for and use it to factor the depressed cubic into a linear and quadratic term. The remaining roots can then be found with the quadratic formula. For example, to solve the (full) cubic equation , use the substitution to get , which is a depressed cubic in the form of Equation . Next, apply the Ferro-Tartaglia formula with and to get .  Since is a root, must be a factor of . Dividing into gives , so that the remaining (duplicate) roots are . The solutions to are obtained by recalling , which yields the three roots , and .  So, by using Tartaglia's work and a clever transformation technique, Cardano was able to crack what had seemed to be the impossible task of solving the general cubic equation. Surprisingly, this development played a significant role in helping to establish the legitimacy of imaginary numbers. Roots of negative numbers, of course, had come up earlier in the simplest of quadratic equations, such as . The solutions we know today as , however, were easy for mathematicians to ignore. In Cardano's time, negative numbers were still being treated with some suspicion, as it was difficult to conceive of any physical reality corresponding to them. Taking square roots of such quantities was surely all the more ludicrous. Nevertheless, Cardano made some genuine attempts to deal with . Unfortunately, his geometric thinking made it hard to make much headway. At one point he commented that the process of arithmetic that deals with quantities such as  involves mental tortures and is truly sophisticated. At another point he concluded that the process is as refined as it is useless. Many mathematicians held this view, but finally there was a breakthrough.  In his 1572 treatise L'Algebra, Rafael Bombelli showed that roots of negative numbers have great utility. Consider the depressed cubic . Using Formula , we compute   Simplifying this expression would have been very difficult if Bombelli had not come up with what he called a wild thought. He suspected that if the original depressed cubic had real solutions, then the two parts of in the preceding equation could be written as and for some real numbers and . That is, Bombelli believed and , which would mean . Then, using the well-known algebraic identity , and assuming that roots of negative numbers obey the rules of algebra, he obtained .  By equating like parts of Equations and Bombelli reasoned that and . Perhaps thinking even more wildly, Bombelli then supposed that and were integers. The only integer factors of 2 are 2 and 1, so the equation led Bombelli to conclude that and . From this conclusion it follows that , or . Amazingly, and solve the second equation , so Bombelli declared the values for and to be and , respectively.  Since , we clearly have . Similarly, Bombelli showed that , so that , which was a proverbial bombshell. Prior to Bombelli, mathematicians could easily scoff at imaginary numbers when they arose as solutions to quadratic equations. With cubic equations, they no longer had this luxury. That was a correct solution to the equation was indisputable, as it could be checked easily. However, to arrive at this very real solution, mathematicians had to take a detour through the uncharted territory of imaginary numbers. Thus, whatever else might have been said about these numbers (which, today, we call complex numbers ), their utility could no longer be ignored.    Geometric Progress of John Wallis  As significant as Bombelli's work was his results left many issues unresolved. For example, his technique applied only to a few specialized cases. Could it be extended? Even if it could be extended a larger question remained: What possible physical representation could complex numbers have? That question remained unanswered for more than two centuries. Paul J. Nahin's book An Imaginary Tale: the Story of  describes the progress in answering it as occurring in several stages. A preliminary step came in 1685 when the English mathematician John Wallis published A Treatise of Algebra, both Historical and Practical .  Among the many contributions in that book two are particularly noteworthy for our purposes. They are displayed in Wallis' analysis of a problem from classical geometry that, at first glance, seems completely unrelated to complex numbers.   Classical Geometry Problem   Construct a triangle determined by two sides and an angle not included between those sides.    We will get to Wallis' contributions in a moment. First, observe that Figure illustrates the standard solution to this classical problem. Given side length (represented by segment ), angle (determined by segments and ), and side length , draw an arc of radius whose center is at point . If the arc intersects segment at points and , then the resulting triangles and each satisfy the problem requirement.   The standard solution to Wallis' problem      A Geometric Representation of Real Numbers  Wallis' first contribution allowed him to associate numbers with the points and of Figure . The association came by way of a construct that may sound completely trivial to us, but that is only because we have been raised with Wallis' idea: the number line. By choosing an arbitrary point to represent the number zero on a given line, Wallis declared that positive numbers could be viewed as corresponding distances to the right of zero, and negative numbers as corresponding (positive) distances to the left of zero.  To complete the association refer to Figure and think of segment as lying on a portion of the -axis. Then draw a perpendicular segment to and designate to be the origin. If the length of is the Pythagorean theorem gives for the length of segments and .   Wallis' depiction of real numbers    Combining this result with Wallis' number line results in points and representing the numbers   Thus, if and , points and would represent and , respectively, because .  From both an algebraic and geometric viewpoint this procedure only makes sense if the stipulated length is greater than or equal to . If were less than then the algebraic expressions for points and ( and ) would be meaningless, as the quantity inside the square root would be negative. Viewed geometrically, if were less than then the arc of radius that is centered at would not be able to intersect segment . In other words, if were less than , Problem would appear to have no solution.    A Geometric Representation of Complex Numbers  Appearances, of course, can be deceiving, and Wallis reinforced the truth of that ancient proverb when he came up with his second and bolder contribution. It was a solution Problem in the case when is less than . Figure illustrates how he did it. From the midpoint of Wallis drew a circle with diameter . Then, with as a center he drew an arc of radius . Because is less than the arc will intersect the circle at two points, say and .   Wallis' depiction of complex numbers    Again we get two triangles: and . Wallis claimed that these triangles each satisfy the requirement of Problem . You might object to this construction on the grounds that angle is not part of either triangle. If you read the problem statement carefully, however, you will notice that it never states that the angle has to be part of any triangle, only that it must play a role in determining a triangle. From this perspective Wallis completely satisfied the requirement.  Notice, also, that points and are no longer on the -axis as they were when was greater than (and when was a real number). They are now somewhere above the -axis, and it is not unreasonable to conclude that points and give, respectively, geometric representations of the expressions and when is less than (and when is a complex number).  Although Wallis only hinted at such a conclusion, he nevertheless helped set the stage for thinking of real numbers as being embedded in a larger set of complex numbers, and that these numbers could be represented as points in the plane. Unfortunately, if we tried to apply Wallis' method to construct complex numbers we would find it had some serious defects. For example, if and the expression becomes , and points and now coincide at point . But we surely would not want to say that and are the same number. Thus, even with Wallis' work the jigsaw of getting a legitimate picture of complex numbers remained. It would be yet another century before someone put most of the pieces together.    Caspar Wessel Makes a Breakthrough  Points in the plane can also be thought of as vectors, which are directed line segments from the origin to those points. In 1797 Caspar Wessel presented a paper to the Danish Academy of Sciences in which he described how to manipulate vectors geometrically. This description eventually led to the current representation of complex numbers.  To add two vectors, make a copy of the second vector and place its tail on the head of the first vector. The resultant vector is the directed line segment drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second copy vector. Figure illustrates the addition of vector to vector .  When Wessel gave his paper the procedure for adding vectors was already known. The unique contribution that he made was his description of how to multiply two vectors.  To understand Wessel's thinking recall that any non-zero vector can be represented by two quantities: its length, and its angular displacement from the positive -axis. Figure illustrates this idea for vector : its length is , and its angular displacement from the positive -axis is .   Addition of two vectors     Length and direction of a vector    The geometry of vectors  Wessel stated that, to multiply two vectors, the length of the product vector should be the product of the lengths of its factors. Should the angular displacement of the product vector likewise be the product of the angular displacements of its factors? Definitely not, and you will see in the exercises why Wessel knew that such a provision would have been a bad idea. What, then, should be the angular displacement of the product?  In answering this question Wessel drew an analogy from the multiplication of real numbers. He observed that, if , then , and . In other words, the ratio of the product to any given factor is the same as the ratio of the other factor to the number one.  What vector represents the number one? It seems obvious that, using the number line of Wallis, it should be the directed line segment from the origin to the number one on the positive -axis. Let's call this vector the standard unit vector , as illustrated in Figure .   The standard unit vector    With this identification in mind, and using the multiplication analogy just mentioned, Wessel made a brilliant move. He reasoned that the (angular) displacement of the product of two vectors should differ from the displacement of any given factor by the same amount that the displacement of the other factor differs from the displacement of the standard unit vector. That's quite a mouthful; let's see what it means.  What is the (angular) displacement of the standard unit vector? Clearly, its displacement is zero radians, as it coincides with the positive -axis. Thus, if vectors and have displacements of and , respectively, and vector , then the displacement of should be , as shown in Figure . The reason for this assertion is that, with such an arrangement, Wessel's displacement protocol works out perfectly: the displacement of (which is ) differs from the displacement of (which is ) by . This is the same amount that the displacement of (which is ) differs from the displacement of the standard unit vector (which is 0). Likewise, the displacement of differs from the displacement of by , which is the same amount that the displacement of differs from the displacement of the standard unit vector.   Multiplication of two vectors    How does Wessel's procedure lead to a geometric representation of complex numbers? Consider what happens if a unit vector is drawn from the origin straight up the -axis, and then multiplied by itself. By Wessel's rules the length of the product vector is one unit, as the length of each factor is one unit. What about its direction? The angular displacement of the original vector is radians, so by Wessel's rules again the product vector has a displacement of radians. Thus, the product vector is aligned along the -axis, but is directed from the origin to the left by one unit, as shown in Figure .   The square root of \\hspace{\\fill} \\caption{Wessel's multiplication scheme for vectors}  Using Wallis' number line we see that the product vector is naturally identified with the number . Label the original vector as . What do you conclude? Obviously, that , which must mean that . Neat!  Neat, yes, but the material we presented leading up to this result was (if you'll pardon the pun) complex. Thus, you need not worry if you had some difficulty following it. Subsequent sections of this chapter will flesh out these ideas more comprehensively.  It should be pointed out that Wessel was not the only mathematician or even the first who began thinking of complex numbers as vectors, or, as points in the plane. As early as 1732 the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (pronounced oiler ) adopted this view concerning the solutions to the equation . You will learn shortly that these solutions can be expressed as for various values of . Euler thought of them as being located at the vertices of a regular polygon in the plane. Euler was also the first to use the symbol for . Today this notation is still the most popular, although some electrical engineers prefer the symbol instead so that they can use to represent current.  Two additional mathematicians deserve mention. The Frenchman Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789 1857) formulated many of the classic theorems that are now part of the corpus of complex analysis. The German Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 1855) reinforced the utility of complex numbers by using them in his several proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra (see ). In an 1831 paper, he produced a clear geometric representation of by identifying it with the point in the coordinate plane. He also described how to perform arithmetic operations with these new numbers.  It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that in 1831 complex numbers were transformed into legitimacy. In that same year the prolific logician Augustus De Morgan commented in his book, On the Study and Difficulties of Mathematics,  We have shown the symbol to be void of meaning, or rather self-contradictory and absurd. Nevertheless, by means of such symbols, a part of algebra is established which is of great utility.   There are, indeed, genuine logical problems associated with complex numbers. For example, with real numbers so long as both sides of the equation are defined. Applying this identity to complex numbers leads to . Plausible answers to these problems can be given, however, and you will learn how to resolve this apparent contradiction in Section . De Morgan's remark illustrates that many factors are needed to persuade mathematicians to adopt new theories. In this case, as always, a firm logical foundation was crucial, but so, too, was a willingness to modify some ideas concerning certain well-established properties of numbers.  As time passed, mathematicians gradually refined their thinking, and by the end of the nineteenth century complex numbers were firmly entrenched. Thus, as it is with many new mathematical or scientific innovations, the theory of complex numbers evolved by way of a very intricate process. But what is the theory that Tartaglia, Ferro, Cardano, Bombelli, Wallis, Euler, Cauchy, Gauss, and so many others helped produce? That is, how do we now think of complex numbers? We explore this question in the remainder of this chapter.   Exercises   Show that .   Mimic the argument the text gives in showing .

  "body": " The Algebra of Complex Numbers, Part I  We have shown that complex numbers came to be viewed as ordered pairs of real numbers. That is, a complex number is defined to be , where and are both real numbers.  The reason we say ordered pair is because we are thinking of a point in the plane. The point , for example, is not the same as . The order in which we write and in Equation makes a difference. Clearly, then, two complex numbers are equal if and only if their coordinates are equal and their coordinates are equal. In other words, . (Throughout this text, iff means if and only if. )  A meaningful number system requires a method for combining ordered pairs. The definition of algebraic operations must be consistent so that the sum, difference, product, and quotient of any two ordered pairs will again be an ordered pair. The key to defining how these numbers should be manipulated is to follow Gauss's lead and equate with . Then, if and are arbitrary complex numbers, we have .  Thus, the following definitions should make sense.   Addition   .    Subtraction   .     If and , then .  We can also use the notation and : .    Given the rationale we devised for addition and subtraction, it is tempting to define the product as . It turns out, however, that this is not a good definition, and we ask you in the exercises for this section to explain why. How, then, should products be defined? Again, if we equate with and assume, for the moment, that makes sense (so that ), we have .  It appears, therefore, that we are forced into the following definition.   Multiplication   .     If and , then .  We get the same answer by using the notation and : .    Of course, it makes sense that the answer came out as we expected because we used the notation as motivation for our definition in the first place. Exercise asks you to show that Wessel's analogy for the norm and angular displacement discussed in Section leads to the same rule for multiplication as that given in Definition .  To motivate our definition for division, we proceed along the same lines as we did for multiplication, assuming that : .  We need to figure out a way to write the preceding quantity in the form . To do so, we use a standard technique and multiply the numerator and denominator by , which gives .  Thus we finally arrive at a rather odd definition.   Division   .     If and , then . As with the example for multiplication, we also get this answer if we use the notation : .    To perform operations on complex numbers, mathematicians use the notation and engage in algebraic manipulations, as we did here, rather than apply the complicated-looking definitions we gave for those operations on ordered pairs. This procedure is valid because we used the notation as a guide for defining the operations in the first place. Remember, though, that the notation is nothing more than a convenient bookkeeping device for keeping track of how to manipulate ordered pairs. It is the ordered pair algebraic definitions that form the real foundation on which the complex number system is based. In fact, if you were to program a computer to do arithmetic on complex numbers, your program would perform calculations on ordered pairs, using exactly the definitions that we gave.  It turns out that our algebraic definitions give complex numbers all the properties we normally ascribe to the real number system. Taken together, they describe what algebraists call a field. In formal terms, a field is a set (in this case, the complex numbers) together with two binary operations (in this case, addition and multiplication) having the following properties.    (P1) Commutative law for addition:  .     (P2) Associative law for addition:  .     (P3) Additive identity: There is a complex number such that for all complex numbers . The number is obviously the ordered pair .     (P4) Additive inverses: For any complex number , there is a unique complex number (depending on ) with the property that . Obviously, if , the number will be .     (P5) Commutative law for multiplication:  .     (P6) Associative law for multiplication:  .     (P7) Multiplicative identity: There is a complex number such that for all complex numbers . As you might expect, is the unique complex number having this property. We ask you to verify this identity in the exercises for this section.     (P8) Multiplicative inverses: For any complex number other than the number , there is a complex number (depending on ), which we denote , having the property that . Based on our definition for division, it seems reasonable that the number would be . We ask you to confirm this result in the exercises for this section.     (P9) The distributive law:  .     None of these properties is difficult to prove. Most of the proofs make use of corresponding facts in the real number system. To illustrate, we give a proof of property (P1) .   Proof of the commutative law for addition:   Let and be arbitrary complex numbers. Then .  Actually, you can think of the real number system as a subset of the complex number system. To see why, let's agree that, as any complex number of the form is on the axis, we can identify it with the real number . With this correspondence, we can easily verify that our definitions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers are consistent with the corresponding operations on real numbers. For example, if and are real numbers, then   It is now time to show specifically how the symbol relates to the quantity . Note that   If we use the symbol for the point , the preceding identity gives , which means . So, the next time you are having a discussion with your friends and they scoff when you claim that is not imaginary, calmly put your pencil on the point of the coordinate plane and ask them if there is anything imaginary about it. When they agree there isn't, you can tell them that this point, in fact, represents the mysterious in the same way that represents the number 1.  We can also see more clearly now how the notation equates to . Using the preceding conventions (\\ie, , etc.), we have   Thus, we may move freely between the notations and , depending on which is more convenient for the context in which we are working. Students sometimes wonder whether it matters where the is located in writing a complex number. It does not. Generally, most texts place terms containing an at the end of an expression, and place the before a variable, but after a constant. Thus, we write , etc., but and so forth. Because letters lower in the alphabet generally denote constants, you will usually (but not always) see the expression instead of . Many authors write quantities like instead of to make sure the is not mistakenly thought to be inside the square root symbol. Additionally, if there is concern that the might be missed, it is sometimes placed before a lengthy expression, as in .  We close this section with three important definitions and a theorem involving them. We ask you for a proof of the theorem in the exercises.   Real Part   The real part of , denoted , is the real number .     Imaginary Part   The imaginary part of , denoted , is the real number .     Conjugate   The conjugate of , denoted , is the complex number .       . Also, .      Suppose that , , and are arbitrary complex numbers. Then the following identities hold true: .    Because of what it erroneously connotes, it is a shame that the term imaginary is used in Definition . It was coined by the brilliant mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596 1650) during an era when quantities such as were thought to be just that. Gauss, who was successful in getting mathematicians to adopt the phrase complex number rather than imaginary number, also suggested that we use lateral part of in place of imaginary part of . Unfortunately, that suggestion never caught on, and it appears we are stuck with what history has handed down to us.

  "body": " The Geometry of Complex Numbers, Part I  Complex numbers are ordered pairs of real numbers, so they can be represented by points in the plane. In this section we show the effect that algebraic operations on complex numbers have on their geometric representations.  We can represent the number by a position vector in the plane whose tail is at the origin and whose head is at the point . When the plane is used for displaying complex numbers, it is called the complex plane, or more simply, the z plane. Recall that and . Geometrically, is the projection of onto the axis, and is the projection of onto the axis. It makes sense, then, to call the axis the real axis and the axis the imaginary axis, as Figure illustrates.   The complex plane    Addition of complex numbers is analogous to addition of vectors in the plane. As we saw in Section , the sum of and is . Hence can be obtained using the parallelogram law for vectors, where the vector sum is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the two original vectors, as illustrated by Figure . The difference can be represented by the displacement vector from the point to the point , as Figure depicts.   The sum     The difference {0.5\\textwidth}    Modulus   The modulus, or absolute value , of the complex number is a nonnegative real number denoted by and defined by the relation .    The number is the distance between the origin and the point . The only complex number with modulus zero is the number 0. The number has modulus , and is depicted in Figure .   The real and imaginary parts of a complex number    The numbers , and are the lengths of the sides of the right triangle shown in Figure . The inequality means that the point is closer to the origin than the point . Although obvious from Figure , it is still profitable to work out algebraically (which we ask you to do in the exercises) that .   The modulus of and its components    The difference represents the displacement vector from to , so the distance between and is given by . We can obtain this distance by using Definitions and to obtain the familiar formula .  If , then is the reflection of through the origin, and is the reflection of through the axis, as illustrated in Figure    The geometry of negation and conjugation    We can use an important algebraic relationship to establish properties of the absolute value that have geometric applications. Its proof is rather straightforward, and we ask you to give it in the exercises for this section. .  An important application of Identity is its use in establishing the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the third side. Figure illustrates this inequality.   The triangle inequality   If and are arbitrary complex numbers, then .     The triangle inequality     We appeal to basic results: .  Taking square roots yields the desired inequality.     To produce an example of which Figure is a reasonable illustration, let and . Then and . Clearly, ; hence . In this case, we can verify the triangle inequality without appealing to calculator approximations because     We can also establish other important identities by means of the triangle inequality. Note that .  Subtracting from the left and right sides of this string of inequalities gives an important relationship that is used in determining lower bounds of sums of complex numbers: .  From Identity and the commutative and associative laws, it follows that .  Taking square roots of the terms on the left and right establishes another important identity: .  As an exercise, we ask you to show that .    If and , then and . Also ; hence .     Figure illustrates the multiplication shown in Example . The length of the vector apparently equals the product of the lengths of and , confirming Equation , but why is it located in the second quadrant when both and are in the first quadrant?

  "body": " The Geometry of Complex Numbers, Part II  In Section we saw that a complex number could be viewed as a vector in the plane with its tail at the origin and its head at the point . A vector can be uniquely specified by giving its magnitude (\\ie, its length) and direction (\\ie, the angle it makes with the positive axis). In this section, we focus on these two geometric aspects of complex numbers.  Let be the modulus of (\\ie, ) and let be the angle that the line from the origin to the complex number makes with the positive axis. (Note: The number is undefined if . Then, as Figure (a) shows, .   Polar representation of complex numbers     Polar Representation   Identity is known as a polar representation of , and the values and are called polar coordinates of .      If , then and is a polar representation of . The polar coordinates in this case are , and .    As Figure (b) shows, can be any value for which the identities and hold. For , the collection of all values of for which is denoted . Formally, we have the following definitions.     If , .  If , we say that is an argument of .    Note that we write as opposed to . We do so because is a set, and the designation indicates that belongs to that set. Note also that, if and , then there exists some integer such that .    Because , we have     Mathematicians have agreed to single out a special choice of . It is that value of for which , as the following definition indicates.     Let be a complex number. Then .  If , we call the argument of .       .     Clearly, if , where , then , where . Note that, for any real number is a set (as opposed to , which is a number). We specifically identify as a proper subset of because has period , whereas and have period . In selecting the proper values for , we must be careful in specifying the choices of so that the point associated with and lies in the appropriate quadrant.     If , then and . It would be a mistake to use as an acceptable value for , as the point associated with and is in the first quadrant, whereas is in the third quadrant. A correct choice for is because , where is any integer. Notice also, that , which illustrates that is indeed a proper subset of .      If , it would be a mistake to attempt to find by looking at , as , so is undefined. If is on the axis, then .  In this case, and .    As you will see in Chapter , is a discontinuous function of because it jumps by an amount of as crosses the negative real axis.  In Chapter we define for any complex number . You will see that this complex exponential has all the properties of real exponentials that you studied in earlier mathematics courses. That is, , and so on. You will also see, amazingly, that if , then .  We will establish this result rigorously in , but there is a plausible explanation we can give now. If has the normal properties of an exponential, it must be that . Now, recall from Calculus the values of three infinite series: . Substituting for in the infinite series for gives . At this point our argument loses rigor because we have not talked about infinite series of complex numbers, let alone whether such series converge. Nevertheless, if we merely take the last series as a formal expression and split it into two series according to whether the index is even ( ) or odd ( ), we get .  Thus, it seems the only possible value for is that given by Equation . We will use this result freely from now on, and, as stated, supply a rigorous proof in Chapter .  If we set and let take the role of in Equation , we get a famous result known as Euler's formula : .  If is a real number, will be located somewhere on the circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. This assertion is easy to verify because .   Figure illustrates the location of for various values of .   The location of for various values of    Note that, when , we get , so .  Euler was the first to discover this relationship; it is referred to as Euler's identity . It has been labeled by many mathematicians as the most amazing relation in analysis and with good reason. Symbols with a rich history are miraculously woven together the constant used by Hippocrates as early as 400 b.c. ; , the base of the natural logarithms; the basic concepts of addition ( ) and equality ( ); the foundational whole numbers 0 and 1; and , the number that is the central focus of this book.  Euler's Formula is of tremendous use in establishing important algebraic and geometric properties of complex numbers. You will see shortly that it enables you to multiply complex numbers with great ease. It also allows you to express a polar form of the complex number in a more compact way. Recall that, if and   , then . Using Euler's Formula we can now write in its exponential form: .    With reference to Example , with , we have .    Together with the rules for exponentiation that we will verify in , Equation has interesting applications. If and , then .   Figure illustrates the geometric significance of this equation.   The product of two complex numbers    We have already shown that the modulus of the product is the product of the moduli; that is, . Identity establishes that an argument of is an argument of plus an argument of . It also answers the question posed at the end of Section regarding why the product was in a different quadrant than either or . It further offers an interesting explanation as to why the product of two negative real numbers is a positive real number. The negative numbers, each of which has an angular displacement of radians, combine to produce a product that is rotated to a point with an argument of radians, coinciding with the positive real axis.  Using exponential form, if , we can write a bit more compactly as .  Doing so enables us to see a nice relationship between the sets , and :    If and , then as sets, .    Before proceeding with the proof of this theorem, we recall two important facts about sets. First, to establish the equality of two sets, we must show that each is a subset of the other. Second, the sum of two sets is the sum of all combinations of elements from the first and second sets, respectively. In this case, .   Let . Because , it follows from Formula that . By Equation there is some integer such that . Further, as . Likewise, gives . But if , then . This result shows that . Thus, . The proof that is left as an exercise.   Using Equality gives . In other words, .  Recalling that and , we also have   If is in the first quadrant, the positions of the numbers , , and are as shown in Figure when . Figure depicts the situation when .   Relative positions of , and , when     Relative positions of , and , when      If , then and . Therefore and has modulus .      If and , then representative polar forms for these numbers are and .

  "body": " The Algebra of Complex Numbers, Part II  The real numbers are deficient in the sense that not all algebraic operations on them produce real numbers. Thus, for to make sense, we must consider the domain of complex numbers. Do complex numbers have this same deficiency? That is, if we are to make sense of expressions such as , must we appeal to yet another new number system? The answer to this question is no. In other words, any reasonable algebraic operation performed on complex numbers gives complex numbers. Later we show how to evaluate intriguing expressions such as . For now we only look at integral powers and roots of complex numbers.  The important players in this regard are the exponential and polar forms of a non-zero complex number . By the laws of exponents (which, you recall, we have promised to prove in Chapter ) we have .    Show that in two ways.    (Method 1): The binomial formula ( Exercise of Section ) gives .    (Method 2): Using Identity and Example yields .    Which method would you use if you were asked to compute ?    Evaluate .     .    An interesting application of the laws of exponents comes from putting the equation in its polar form. Doing so gives , which is known as De Moivre's formula, in honor of the French mathematician Abraham De Moivre (1667 1754).    Use De Moivre's formula (Equation ) to show that   .    If we let and use the binomial formula the left side of Equation becomes .  The real part of this expression is . Equating this to the real part of on the right side of Equation establishes the desired result.    A key aid in determining roots of complex numbers is a corollary to the fundamental theorem of algebra. We prove this theorem in Chapter . Our proofs must be independent of the conclusions we derive here because we are going to make use of the corollary now.   Corollary to the fundamental theorem of algebra   { } If  is a polynomial of degree , with complex coefficients, then the equation   has precisely   (not necessarily distinct) solutions.      Refer to Chapter .     Let . This polynomial of degree 3 can be written as . Hence the equation has solutions , , and . Thus, in accordance with Theorem , we have three solutions, with and being repeated roots.     Theorem implies that, if we can find \\mathit{n} distinct solutions to the equation (or , we will have found all the solutions. We begin our search for these solutions by looking at the simpler equation . Solving this equation will enable us to handle the more general one quite easily.  To solve we first note that, from Identities and , we can deduce an important condition that determines when two nonzero complex numbers are equal. If we let and , then , where is an integer. That is, two complex numbers are equal iff their moduli agree and an argument of one equals an argument of the other to within an integral multiple of .  We now find all solutions to in two stages, with each stage corresponding to one direction in the iff part of Relation . First, we show that if we have a solution to , then the solution must have a certain form. Second, we show that any quantity with that form is indeed a solution.  For the first stage, suppose that is a solution to . Putting the latter equation in exponential form gives , so Relation implies that and . In other words, , where is an integer.  So, if  is a solution to , then Relation must be true. This observation completes the first stage of our solution strategy. For the second stage, we note that if  , and , then is indeed a solution to because . For example, if and , then is a solution to because .  Furthermore, it is easy to verify that we get n distinct solutions to (and, therefore, all solutions, by Theorem ) by setting . The solutions for merely repeat those for , because the arguments so generated agree to within an integral multiple of . The solutions can be expressed as .  They are called the th roots of unity.  When in Equation , we get , which is a rather trivial result. The first interesting root of unity occurs when , giving . This particular value shows up so often that mathematicians have given it a special symbol.   Primitive $n$th root   For any natural number , the value given by is called the primitive th root of unity.    By De Moivre's formula Equation the roots of unity can be expressed as .  Geometrically, the th roots of unity are equally spaced points that lie on the unit circle and form the vertices of a regular polygon with sides, which as we mentioned in Section is a fact discovered by Leonard Euler.    The solutions to the equation are given by the eight values , for . In Cartesian form, these solutions are , and . The primitive 8th root of unity is .    From Expressions it is clear that of Equation , as Figure illustrates.   The eight eighth roots of unity    The procedure for solving is easy to generalize in solving for any nonzero complex number . If and , then iff . But this last equation is satisfied iff   As before, we get distinct solutions given by .  Each solution in Equation can be considered an th root of . Geometrically, the th roots of are equally spaced points that lie on the circle and form the vertices of a regular polygon with sides. Figure illustrates the case for .   The five solutions to the equation    It is interesting to note that if is any particular solution to the equation , then all solutions can be generated by multiplying by the various n th roots of unity. That is, the solution set is .  The reason for this is that, if , then for any , , and that multiplying a number by increases an argument of that number by , so that Expressions contains n distinct values.    Find all cube roots of .    Formula gives .  The Cartesian forms of the solutions are , , and , as shown in Figure      The point and its three cube roots, , , and    Is the quadratic formula valid in the complex domain? The answer is yes , provided we are careful with our terms.   Quadratic formula   { } If , then the solution set for is , where by we mean all distinct square roots of the number inside the parenthesis.     The proof is left as an exercise.     Find all solutions to the equation .   The quadratic formula gives .   As , Equations give , for and 1. In Cartesian form, this expression reduces to and . Thus, our solution set is , or .    In Exercise of Section we asked you to show that a polynomial with non real coefficients must have some roots that do not occur in complex conjugate pairs. This last example gives an illustration of such a phenomenon.   Exercises   Calculate the following.      .          .     Show that   by squaring twice .  by using De Moivre's formula, given in Equation .    Use the method of Example to establish trigonometric identities for and .    .

Find all the roots of the equation given that is a root.   Since the coefficients are real, roots come in conjugates. Thus, , and are factors.

  "title": "The Topology of Complex Numbers",
  "body": " The Topology of Complex Numbers  In this section we investigate some basic ideas concerning sets of points in the plane. The first concept is that of a curve. Intuitively, we think of a curve as a piece of string placed on a flat surface in some type of meandering pattern. More formally, we define a curve to be the range of a continuous complex-valued function defined on the interval . That is, a curve is the range of a function given by , for , where both and are continuous real-valued functions. If both and are differentiable, we say that the curve is smooth. A curve for which and are differentiable except for a finite number of points is called piecewise smooth . We specify a curve as , and say that is a parametrization for the curve . Note that, with this parametrization, we are specifying a direction for the curve , saying that is a curve that goes from the initial point to the terminal point . If we had another function whose range was the same set of points as but whose initial and final points were reversed, we would indicate the curve that this function defines by .    Find parameterizations for and , where is the straight line segment beginning at and ending at .    Refer to Figure . The vector form of a line shows that the direction of is . As is a point on , its vector equation is .   The straight-line segment joining to    Using the same technique we see that one parametrization for is .    Comparing Equations and illustrates a general principle: If is a curve parametrized by for , then one parametrization for will be , for .  A curve having the property that is said to be a closed curve. The line segment of Expression is not a closed curve. The range of , where , and for is a closed curve because . The range of is the four-leaved rose shown in Figure . Note that, as goes from 0 to , the point is on leaf 1; from to , it is on leaf 2; between and , it is on leaf 3; and finally, for between and , it is on leaf 4.  Note further that, at , the curve has crossed over itself (at points other than those corresponding with and ); we want to be able to distinguish when a curve does not cross over itself in this way. The curve is called simple if it does not cross over itself, except possibly at its initial and terminal points. In other words, the curve , for , is simple provided that whenever , except possibly when and .   The four-leaved rose: , for      Show that the circle with center and radius can be parametrized to form a simple closed curve.    Note that , for , gives the required parametrization.     Figure shows that, as varies from 0 to , the circle is traversed counterclockwise. If you were traveling around the circle in this manner, its interior would be on your left. When a simple closed curve is parametrized in this fashion, we say that the curve has a positive orientation. We will have more to say about this idea shortly.   The simple closed curve , for    We need to develop some vocabulary that will help describe sets of points in the plane. One fundamental idea is that of an -neighborhood of the point . It is the open disk of radius about shown in Figure . Formally, it is the set of all points satisfying the inequality and is denoted by . That is, .   An -neighborhood of the point      The solution sets of the inequalities , and are neighborhoods of the points , and , with radii 1, 2, and 3, respectively. They can also be expressed as , and .    We also define , the closed disk of radius centered at , and , the punctured disk of radius centered at as .  The point is said to be an interior point of the set provided that there exists an -neighborhood of that contains only points of ; is called an exterior point of the set if there exists an -neighborhood of that contains no points of . If is neither an interior point nor an exterior point of , then it is called a boundary point of and has the property that each -neighborhood of contains both points in and points not in . Figure illustrates this situation.   The interior, exterior, and boundary of a set    The boundary of is the circle depicted in Figure . We denote this circle and refer to it as the circle of radius R centered at . Thus .  We use the notation to indicate that the parametrization we chose for this simple closed curve resulted in a positive orientation; denotes the same circle, but with a negative orientation. (In both cases, counterclockwise denotes the positive direction.) Using notation that we have already introduced, we get .    Let . Find the interior, exterior, and boundary of .    We show that every point of is an interior point of . Let be a point of . Then , and we can choose . We claim that . If , then .  Hence the -neighborhood of is contained in , which shows that is an interior point of . It follows that the interior of is the set itself. PARAGRAPH Similarly, it can be shown that the exterior of is , and the boundary of is the unit circle . These claims follow from that fact that, if is any point on the circle, then any -neighborhood of will contain two points: , which belongs to ; and , which does not belong to . We leave the details of demonstrating this claim as an exercise.    The point is called an accumulation point of the set if, for each , the punctured disk contains at least one point of . We ask you to show in the exercises that the set of accumulation points of is , and that there is only one accumulation point of , namely, the point . We also ask you to prove that a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its accumulation points.  A set is called an open set if every point of is an interior point of . Thus, Example shows that is open. A set is called a closed set if it contains all its boundary points. A set is said to be a connected set if every pair of points and contained in can be joined by a curve that lies entirely in . Roughly speaking, a connected set consists of a single piece. The unit disk is a connected open set. We ask you to verify in the exercises that, if and lie in , then the straight-line segment joining them lies entirely in . The annulus is a connected open set because any two points in can be joined by a curve that lies entirely in , as shown in Figure .   The annulus is a connected set    The set consists of two disjoint disks. We leave it as an exercise for you to show that the set is not connected, as shown in Figure .   The set is not a connected set    We call a connected open set a domain. In the exercises we ask you to show that the open unit disk is a domain and that the closed unit disk is not a domain. The term domain is a noun and is a type of set. In we note that it also refers to the set of points on which a function is defined. In the latter context, it does not necessarily mean a connected open set.    Show that the right half-plane is a domain.    First we show that is connected. Let and be any two points in . We claim the obvious: the straight-line segment given by Equation lies entirely within . To prove this claim, we let , for some , be an arbitrary point on . We must show that . Now, .  If , the last expression becomes , which is greater than zero because . Likewise, if , then the right side of Equation reduces to , which also is positive. Finally, if , then each term in Equation is positive, so in this case we also have . PARAGRAPH To show that is open, we suppose without loss of generality that . We claim that , where . We leave the proof of this claim as an exercise.    A domain, together with some, none, or all its boundary points, is called a region. For example, the horizontal strip is a region. A set formed by taking the union of a domain and its boundary is called a closed region; thus is a closed region. A set is said to be a bounded set if it can be completely contained in some closed disk, that is, if there exists an such that for each in we have . The rectangle given by is bounded because it is contained inside the disk . A set that cannot be enclosed by any closed disk is called an unbounded set.  We mentioned earlier that a simple closed curve is positively oriented if its interior is on the left when the curve is traversed. How do we know, though, that any given simple closed curve will have an interior and exterior? Theorem 1.6 guarantees that this is indeed the case. It is due in part to the work of the French mathematician Camille Jordan (1838 1922).   The Jordan curve theorem   The complement of any simple closed curve \\mathit{C} can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive domains, and , in such a way that is bounded, is unbounded, and is the boundary for both and . In addition, is the entire complex plane. The domain is called the interior of , and the domain is called the exterior of .    The Jordan curve theorem is a classic example of a result in mathematics that seems obvious but is very hard to demonstrate, and its proof is beyond the scope of this book. Jordan's original argument, in fact, was inadequate, and not until 1905 was a correct version finally given by the American topologist Oswald Veblen. The difficulty lies in describing the interior and exterior of a simple closed curve analytically, and in showing that they are connected sets. For example, in which domain (interior or exterior) do the two points depicted in Figure lie? If they are in the same domain, how, specifically, can they be connected with a curve? If you appreciated the subtleties involved in showing that the right half-plane of Example is connected, you can begin to appreciate the obstacles that Veblen had to navigate.  Although an introductory treatment of complex analysis can be given without using this theorem, we think it is important for the well-informed student at least to be aware of it.   Are and in the interior or exterior of this simple closed curve?

When the context is obvious, we omit the phrase complex-valued , and simply refer to a function , or to a complex function .  We can define the domain to be any set that makes sense for a given rule, so for , we could have the entire complex plane for the domain , or we might artificially restrict the domain to some set such as . Determining the range for a function defined by a formula is not always easy, but we will see plenty of examples later on. In some contexts functions are referred to as mappings or transformations .  In Section , we used the term domain to indicate a connected open set. When speaking about the domain of a function , however, we mean only the set of points on which the function is defined. This distinction is worth noting, and context will make clear the use intended.  Just as can be expressed by its real and imaginary parts, , we write , where and are the real and imaginary parts of , respectively. Doing so gives us the representation .

Using the binomial formula, we obtain , so that and .      Express the function in the form .    Using the elementary properties of complex numbers, it follows that , so that and .     Examples and show how to find and when a rule for computing is given. Conversely, if and are two real-valued functions of the real variables and , they determine a complex-valued function , and we can use the formulas to find a formula for involving the variables and .    Express by a formula involving the variables and .    Calculation reveals that .    Using in the expression of a complex function may be convenient. It gives us the polar representation , where and are real functions of the real variables and .   For any specific function , the functions and defined here will be different from those of Equation because Equation involves Cartesian coordinates and Equation involves polar coordinates.     Express in both Cartesian and polar form.   For the Cartesian form, a simple calculation gives so that   For the polar form, we refer to Equation to get , so that    Once we have defined and for a function in Cartesian form, we must use different symbols if we want to express in polar form. As is clear here, the functions and are quite different, as are and . Of course, if we are working only in one context, we can use any symbols we choose.      Express in polar form.    Again, using Equation we obtain .    We now look at the geometric interpretation of a complex function. If is the domain of real-valued functions and , the equations describe a transformation (or mapping) from in the plane into the plane, also called the plane. Therefore, we can also consider the function to be a transformation (or mapping) from the set in the plane onto the range in the plane. This idea was illustrated in Figure . In the following paragraphs we present some additional key ideas. They are staples for any kind of function, and you should memorize all the terms in bold.  If is a subset of the domain of , the set is called the image of the set , and is said to map onto . The image of a single point is a single point, and the image of the entire domain, , is the range, . The mapping is said to be from into if the image of is contained in . Mathematicians use the notation to indicate that a function maps into .   Figure illustrates a function whose domain is and whose range is . The shaded areas depict that the function maps  onto  . The function also maps  into  , and, of course, it maps  onto  .   maps  onto  ; maps  into     The inverse image of a point is the set of all points in such that . The inverse image of a point may be one point, several points, or nothing at all. If the last case occurs then the point is not in the range of . For example, if , the inverse image of the point is the single point , because , and is the only point that maps to . In the case of , the inverse image of the point is the set . You will learn in Chapter that, if , the inverse image of the point is the empty set there is no complex number such that .  The inverse image of a set of points, , is the collection of all points in the domain that map into . If maps onto it is possible for the inverse image of to be function as well, but the original function must have a special property: a function is said to be one-to-one if it maps distinct points onto distinct points . Many times an easy way to prove that a function is one-to-one is to suppose , and from this assumption deduce that must equal . Thus, is one-to-one because if , then . Dividing both sides of the last equation by gives . Figure illustrates the idea of a one-to-one function: distinct points get mapped to distinct points.   A one-to-one function    The function  is not one-to-one. This is because , but . Figure illustrates this situation: at least two different points get mapped to the same point.   A function that is not one-to-one    In the exercises we ask you to demonstrate that one-to-one functions give rise to inverses that are functions. Loosely speaking, if maps the set one-to-one and onto the set , then for each in there exists exactly one point in such that . For any such value of we can take the equation and solve for as a function of . Doing so produces an inverse function where the following equations hold: .  Conversely, if and are functions that map into and into , respectively, and Equations hold, then maps the set one-to-one and onto the set .  Further, if is a one-to-one mapping from into , and if is a subset of , then is a one-to-one mapping from onto its image . We can also show that, if is a one-to-one mapping from onto and is a one-to-one mapping from onto , then the composite mapping is a one-to-one mapping from onto .  We usually indicate the inverse of by the symbol . If the domains of and are and , respectively, we can rewrite Equations as .  Also, for and , .    If  for any complex number , find .    We can easily show is one-to-one and onto the entire complex plane. We solve for , given , to get . By Equations , this result implies that for all complex numbers .     Once we have specified for all complex numbers , we note that there is nothing magical about the symbol . We could just as easily write for all complex numbers .   We now show how to find the image of a specified set under a given mapping . The set is usually described with an equation or inequality involving and . Using inverse functions, we can construct a chain of equivalent statements leading to a description of the set in terms of an equation or an inequality involving and .    Show that the function maps the line in the plane onto the line in the plane.    (Method 1): With , we want to describe . We let and use Equations and Example to get , where means { if and only if }. PARAGRAPH Note what this result says: . The image of under , therefore, is the set . PARAGRAPH (Method 2): We write and note that the transformation can be given by the equations and . Because is described by , we can substitute and into the equation to obtain , which we can rewrite as . If you use this method, be sure to pay careful attention to domains and ranges.    We now look at some elementary mappings. If we let denote a fixed complex constant, the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the plane onto the plane and is called a translation. This transformation can be visualized as a rigid translation whereby the point is displaced through the vector to its new position . The inverse mapping is given by and shows that is a one-to-one mapping from the plane onto the plane. The effect of a translation is depicted in Figure .   The translation    If we let be a fixed real number, then for , the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the plane onto the plane and is called a rotation. It can be visualized as a rigid rotation whereby the point is rotated about the origin through an angle to its new position . If we use polar coordinates and designate in the plane, then the inverse mapping is . This analysis shows that is a one-to-one mapping of the plane onto the plane. The effect of rotation is depicted in Figure .   The rotation      The ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal major axis of four units and vertical minor axis of two units can be represented by the parametric equation . Suppose that we wanted to rotate the ellipse by an angle of radians and shift the center of the ellipse 2 units to the right and 1 unit up. Using complex arithmetic, we can easily generate a parametric equation that does so: .   Figure shows parametric plots of these ellipses.     Plots of (a) the original ellipse; (b) the rotated ellipse    If we let be a fixed positive real number, then the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the plane onto the plane and is called a magnification. If , it has the effect of stretching the distance between points by the factor . If , then it reduces the distance between points by the factor . The inverse transformation is given by and shows that is one-to-one mapping from the plane onto the plane. The effect of magnification is shown in Figure .   The magnification    Finally, if we let and , where is a positive real number, then the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the plane onto the plane and is called a linear transformation. It can be considered as the composition of a rotation, a magnification, and a translation. It has the effect of rotating the plane through an angle given by , followed by a magnification by the factor , followed by a translation by the vector . The inverse mapping is given by and shows that is a one-to-one mapping from the plane onto the plane.    Show that the linear transformation maps the right half-plane onto the upper half-plane .   (Method 1): Let . To describe , we solve for to get . Using Equations and the method of Example we have .   Thus , which is the same as saying .  (Method 2): When we write in Cartesian form as , we see that the transformation can be given by the equations and . Substituting in the inequality gives , or , which is the upper half-plane .  (Method 3): The effect of the transformation is a rotation of the plane through the angle (when is multiplied by ) followed by a translation by the vector . The first operation yields the set . The second shifts this set up 1 unit, resulting in the set .  We illustrate this result in Figure .   The linear transformation      Translations and rotations preserve angles. First, magnifications rescale distance by a factor , so it follows that triangles are mapped onto similar triangles, preserving angles. Then, because a linear transformation can be considered to be a composition of a rotation, a magnification, and a translation, it follows that linear transformations preserve angles. Consequently, any geometric object is mapped onto an object that is similar to the original object; hence linear transformations can be called similarity mappings.    Show that the image of under the transformation is the open disk .   The inverse transformation is , so if we designate the range of as , then .  Hence the disk with center and radius 1 is mapped one-to-one and onto the disk with center and radius 5 as shown in Figure .    The mapping        Show that the image of the right half-plane under the linear transformation is the half-plane .   The inverse transformation is given by , which we write as . Substituting into Re gives , which simplifies to . Figure illustrates the mapping.    The mapping       Exercises   Find for the following functions.      .    .   .   .    .    Let .

If we also use polar coordinates for in the plane, we can express this mapping by the system of equations   Because an argument of the product is twice an argument of , we say that doubles angles at the origin. Points that lie on the ray , are mapped onto points that lie on the ray , . If we now restrict the domain of to the region , then the image of under the mapping can be described by the set , which consists of all points in the plane except the point .  The inverse mapping of , which we denote , is then , where . That is, , where . The function is so important that we call special attention to it with a formal definition.   Principal Square Root   The function , is called the principal square root function.

Figure illustrates this relationship.   The mappings and    What are the images of rectangles under the mapping ? To find out, we use the Cartesian form and the resulting system of equations .    Show that the transformation , for , usually maps vertical and horizontal lines onto parabolas and use this fact to find the image of the rectangle .    Using Equations , we determine that the vertical line is mapped onto the set of points given by the equations and . If , then and .

  "body": " Limits and Continuity  Let be a real-valued function of the two real variables and . Recall that has the limit as approaches provided the value of can be made to get as close as we want to the value by taking to be sufficiently close to . When this happens we write .  In more technical language, has the limit as approaches iff can be made arbitrarily small by making both and small. This condition is like the definition of a limit for functions of one variable. The point is in the plane, and the distance between and is . With this perspective we can now give a precise definition of a limit.   Limit of   The expression means that for each number , there is a corresponding number such that .      Show, if , then  .    If and , then . Because and because , . Hence, for any , Inequality is satisfied for ; that is, has the limit as approaches .    The value of the limit must not depend on how approaches , so must approach the value when approaches along any curve that ends at the point . Conversely, if we can find two curves and that end at along which approaches two distinct values and , then does not have a limit as approaches .    Show that the function does not have a limit as approaches .    If we let approach along the axis, then .  But if we let approach along the line , then . Because the value of the limit differs depending on how approaches , we conclude that does not have a limit as approaches .    Let be a complex function of the complex variable that is defined for all values of in some neighborhood of , except perhaps at the point . We say that has the limit as approaches , provided the value can be made as close as we want to the value by taking to be sufficiently close to . When this happens we write .  The distance between the points and can be expressed by , so we can give a precise definition similar to the one for a function of two variables.   Limit of   The expression means that for each real number , there exists a real number such that . Using the notation of and , we can express the last relationship as     The formulation of limits in terms of open disks provides a good context for looking at this definition. It says that for each disk of radius about the point (represented by ) there is a punctured disk of radius about the point (represented by ) such that the image of each point in the punctured disk lies in the disk. The image of the disk does not have to fill up the entire disk; but if approaches along a curve that ends at , then approaches . The situation is illustrated in Figure .   As the function values      Show that if , then , where is any complex number.    As merely reflects points about the axis, we suspect that any disk about the point would contain the image of the punctured disk about if . To confirm this conjecture, we let be any positive number and set . Then we suppose that , which means that . The modulus of a conjugate is the same as the modulus of the number itself, so the last inequality implies that . This inequality is the same as . Since and , this last inequality becomes , or , which is what we needed to show.    If we consider as a mapping from the plane into the plane and think about the previous geometric interpretation of a limit, then we are led to conclude that the limit of a function should be determined by the limits of its real and imaginary parts, and . This conclusion also gives us a tool for computing limits.    Let be a complex function that is defined in some neighborhood of , except perhaps at . Then iff .     We first assume that Statement is true and show that Statement is true. According to the definition of limit, for each , there is a corresponding such that   ; that is, . Because , we can use Inequalities to conclude that . It now follows that and whenever , and so Statement is true.  Conversely, assume that Statement is true. Then for each , there exists and so that .  We choose to be the minimum of the two values and . Then we can use the triangle inequality to conclude that   ; that is, . Hence the truth of Statement implies the truth of Statement , and the proof of the theorem is complete.     Show that  .    Let . Computing the limits for and , we obtain , so our previous theorem implies that  .    Limits of complex functions are formally the same as those of real functions, and the sum, difference, product, and quotient of functions have limits given by the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the respective limits. We state this result as a theorem and leave the proof as an exercise.    Suppose that  and . Then .     Continuity of   Let be a real-valued function of the two real variables and . We say that is continuous at the point if three conditions are satisfied: .    Condition actually implies Conditions and because the existence of the quantity on each side of Equation is implicitly understood to exist. For example, if when and if , then so that Conditions , , and are satisfied. Hence is continuous at .  There is a similar definition for complex valued functions.   Continuity of   Let be a complex function of the complex variable that is defined for all values of in some neighborhood of . We say that is continuous at if three conditions are satisfied: .      Example shows that the function is continuous.   A complex function is continuous iff its real and imaginary parts, and , are continuous. The proof of this fact is an immediate consequence of Theorem . Continuity of complex functions is formally the same as that of real functions, and sums, differences, and products of continuous functions are continuous; their quotient is continuous at points where the denominator is not zero. These results are summarized by the following theorems. We leave the proofs as exercises.    Let be defined in some neighborhood of Then is continuous at iff and are continuous at .      Suppose that and are continuous at the point . Then the following functions are continuous at :   The sum , where ;    The difference , where ;    The product , where ;    The quotient , where , provided ; and    The composition , where , provided is continuous in a neighborhood of .         Show that the polynomial function given by is continuous at each point in the complex plane.    If is the constant function, then ; and if , then we can use Definition with and the choice to prove that . Using Property and mathematical induction, we obtain .  We can extend Property to a finite sum of terms and use the result of Equation to get . Conditions , , and are satisfied, so we conclude that is continuous at .    One technique for computing limits is to apply Theorem to quotients. If we let and be polynomials and if , then   Another technique involves factoring polynomials. If both and , then and can be factored as and . If , then the limit is     Show that .    Here and can be factored in the form so that the limit is obtained by the calculation .

  "title": "Branches of Functions",
  "body": " Branches of Functions   In Section we defined the principal square root function and investigated some of its properties. We left unanswered some questions concerning the choices of square roots. We now look at these questions because they are similar to situations involving other elementary functions.  In our definition of a function in Section , we specified that each value of the independent variable in the domain is mapped onto one and only one value in the range. As a result, we often talk about a single-valued function, which emphasizes the only one part of the definition and allows us to distinguish such functions from multiple-valued functions, which we now introduce.  Let denote a function whose domain is the set and whose range is the set . If is a value in the range, then there is an associated inverse relation that assigns to each value the value (or values) of in for which the equation holds. But unless takes on the value at most once in , then the inverse relation is necessarily many valued, and we say that is a multivalued function. For example, the inverse of the function is the square root function . For each value other than , then, the two points and are mapped onto the same point ; hence is, in general, a two-valued function.  The study of limits, continuity, and derivatives loses all meaning if an arbitrary or ambiguous assignment of function values is made. For this reason we did not allow multivalued functions to be considered when we defined these concepts. When working with inverse functions, you have to specify carefully one of the many possible inverse values when constructing an inverse function, as when you determine implicit functions in calculus. If the values of a function are determined by an equation that they satisfy rather than by an explicit formula, then we say that the function is defined implicitly or that is an implicit function. In the theory of complex variables we present a similar concept.  We now let be a multiple-valued function. A branch of is any single-valued function that is continuous in some domain (except, perhaps, on the boundary). At each point in the domain, it assigns one of the values of .    We consider some branches of the two-valued square root function  . Define the principal square root function as , where and so that . The function is a branch of . Using the same notation, we can find other branches of the square root function. For example, if we let , then , so and can be thought of as plus and minus square root functions. The negative real axis is called a branch cut for the functions and . Each point on the branch cut is a point of discontinuity for both functions and .      Show that the function is discontinuous along the negative real axis.    Let denote a negative real number. We compute the limit as approaches through the upper half-plane and the limit as approaches through the lower half-plane . In polar coordinates these limits are given by .  The two limits are distinct, so the function is discontinuous at .     Likewise, is discontinuous at . The mappings , , and the branch cut are illustrated in Figure .    The branches and of    We can construct other branches of the square root function by specifying that an argument of given by is to lie in the interval . The corresponding branch is .  The branch cut for is the ray , , which includes the origin. The point , common to all branch cuts for the multivalued square root function, is called a branch point. The mapping and its branch cut are illustrated in Figure .   The branch of      The Riemann Surface for  A Riemann surface is a construct useful for visualizing a multivalued function. It was introduced by G. F. B. Riemann (1826 1866) in 1851. The idea is ingenious a geometric construction that permits surfaces to be the domain or range of a multivalued function. Riemann surfaces depend on the function being investigated. We now give a nontechnical formulation of the Riemann surface for the multivalued square root function.  Consider , which has two values for any . Each function and in Figure is single-valued on the domain formed by cutting the plane along the negative axis. Let and be the domains of and , respectively. The range set for is the set consisting of the right half-plane, and the positive axis; the range set for is the set consisting of the left half-plane and the negative axis. The sets and are glued together along the positive axis and the negative axis to form the plane with the origin deleted.  We stack directly above . The edge of in the upper half-plane is joined to the edge of in the lower half-plane, and the edge of in the lower half-plane is joined to the edge of in the upper half-plane. When these domains are glued together in this manner, they form , which is a Riemann surface domain for the mapping . The portions of , , and that lie in are shown in Figure .  Formation of the Riemann surface for : (a) a portion of and its image under ; (b) a portion of and its image under ; (c) a portion of and its image under .  The beauty of this structure is that it makes this full square root function continuous for all . Normally, the principal square root function would be discontinuous along the negative real axis, as points near but above that axis would get mapped to points close to , and points near but below the axis would get mapped to points close to . As Figure (c) indicates, however, between the point and the point , the domain switches from the edge of in the upper half-plane to the edge of in the lower half-plane. The corresponding mapped points and are exactly where they should be. The surface works in such a way that going directly between the edges of in the upper and lower half-planes is impossible (likewise for ). Going counter-clockwise, the only way to get from the point to the point , for example, is to follow the path indicated by the arrows in Figure (c).   Formation of the Riemann surface for : (a) a portion of and its image under ; (b) a portion of and its image under ; (c) a portion of and its image under     Exercises   Let and be the two branches of the square root function given by Equations and , respectively.

  "body": " The Reciprocal Transformation  The mapping is called the reciprocal transformation . It maps the plane one-to-one and onto the plane except for the point , which has no image. The point has no preimage or inverse image. Using exponential notation , if , we have .  The geometric description of the reciprocal transformation is now evident. It is an inversion (that is, the modulus of is the reciprocal of the modulus of ) followed by a reflection through the axis. The ray , is mapped one-to-one and onto the ray . Points that lie inside the unit circle are mapped onto points that lie outside the unit circle and vice versa, as Figure illustrates.   The reciprocal transformation    We can extend the system of complex numbers by joining to it an ideal point denoted by and called the point at infinity. This new set is called the extended complex plane. You will see shortly that the point has the property, loosely speaking, that iff .  An -neighborhood of the point at infinity is the set . The usual way to visualize the point at infinity is by using what we call the stereographic projection, which is attributed to Riemann. Let be a sphere of diameter 1 that is centered at the point in three-dimensional space where coordinates are specified by the triple of real numbers . Here the complex number is associated with the point .  The point on is called the north pole of . If we let be a complex number and consider the line segment in three-dimensional space that joins to the north pole , then intersects in exactly one point . The correspondence is called the stereographic projection of the complex plane onto the Riemann sphere . A point of unit modulus will correspond with . If has modulus greater than 1, then will lie in the upper hemisphere where for points we have . If has modulus less than 1, then will lie in the lower hemisphere where for points we have . The complex number corresponds with the south pole, . Now you can see that indeed iff iff . Hence corresponds with the ideal point at infinity. The situation is shown in Figure .   The Riemann sphere    Let's reconsider the mapping by assigning the images and to the points and , respectively. We now write the reciprocal transformation as   Note that the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the extended complex plane onto the extended complex plane. Further, is a continuous mapping from the extended plane onto the extended plane. We leave the details to you.    Show that the image of the half-plane under the mapping is the closed disk .    Proceeding as we did in Example 2.6, we get the inverse mapping of as . Then , which describes the disk . As the reciprocal transformation is one-to-one, preimages of the points in the disk will lie in the right half-plane . Figure illustrates this result.     The image of under the mapping     Alas, there is a fly in the ointment here. As our notation indicates, Equations and are not equivalent. The former implies the latter, but not conversely. That is, Equation makes sense when , whereas Equation does not. Yet Figure seems to indicate that maps onto the entire disk , including the point . Actually, it does not, because has no preimage in the complex plane. The way out of this dilemma is to use the complex point at infinity. It is that quantity that gets mapped to the point , for as we have already indicated in Equation , the preimage of under the mapping is indeed .     For the transformation , find the image of the portion of the half plane that is inside the closed disk .    Using the result of Example , we need only find the image of the disk and intersect it with the closed disk . To begin, we note that .  Because , we have, as before, , which is an inequality that determines the set of points in the plane that lie on and outside the circle . Note that we do not have to deal with the point at infinity this time, as the last inequality is not satisfied when . When we intersect this set with , we get the crescent-shaped region shown in Figure .     The mapping discussed in Example    To study images of generalized circles, we consider the equation where , , , and are real numbers. This equation represents either a circle or a line, depending on whether or , respectively. Transforming the equation to polar coordinates gives .  Using the polar coordinate form of the reciprocal transformation given in Equation , we can express the image of the curve in the preceding equation as , which represents either a circle or a line, depending on whether or , respectively. Thus, the reciprocal transformation carries the class of lines and circles onto itself.    Find the images of the vertical lines and the horizontal lines under the mapping .    Considering the point at infinity, the image of the line is the line ; that is, the -axis is mapped onto the -axis. Similarly, the -axis is mapped onto the -axis. The inverse mapping is , so if , the vertical line is mapped onto the set of points satisfying . For , this outcome is equivalent to . which is the equation of a circle in the plane with center and radius . The point at infinity is mapped to . Similarly, is mapped onto the circle . which has center and radius . Figure illustrates the images of several lines.

If it does, we say that the function is differentiable at . If we write , then we can express Equation in the form .  If we let and , then we can use the Leibniz notation for the derivative: .    If , show that .    Using Equation , we have .  We can drop the subscript on to obtain as a general formula.    Pay careful attention to the value in Equation ; the limit must be independent of the manner in which . If we can find two curves that end at along which approaches distinct values, then does not have a limit as , so does not have a derivative at . The same observation applies to the limits in Equations and .    Show that the function is nowhere differentiable.    We choose two approaches to the point and compute limits of the difference quotients. First, we approach along a line parallel to the -axis by forcing to be of the form . .  Next, we approach along a line parallel to the axis by forcing to be of the form . .  The limits along the two paths are different, so there is no possible value for the right side of Equation . Therefore is not differentiable at the point , and since was arbitrary, is nowhere differentiable.     In Section we showed that is continuous for all . Thus, we have a simple example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. Such functions are hard to construct in real variables. In some sense, the complex case has made pathological constructions simpler!   We seldom are interested in studying functions that aren't differentiable, or are differentiable at only a single point. Complex functions that have a derivative at all points in a neighborhood of deserve further study. Indeed, functions that are differentiable in neighborhoods of points are pillars of the complex analysis edifice. We give them a special name, as indicated in the following definition.   Analytic   The complex function is analytic at the point provided there is some such that exists for all . In other words, must be differentiable not only at , but also at all points in some -neighborhood of .    If is analytic at each point in the region , then we say that is analytic on . Again, we have a special term if is analytic on the whole complex plane.   Entire   If is analytic on the whole complex plane then is said to be entire.    Points of non analyticity for a function are called singular points. They are important for certain applications in physics and engineering.  Our definition of the derivative for complex functions is formally the same as for real functions and is the natural extension from real variables to complex variables. The basic differentiation formulas are identical to those for real functions, and we obtain the same rules for differentiating powers, sums, products, quotients, and compositions of functions. We can easily establish the proof of the differentiation formulas by using the limit theorems.  Suppose that and are differentiable. From Equation and the technique exhibited in the solution to Example , we can establish the following rules, which are virtually identical to those for real-valued functions. .  Important particular cases of Equations and , respectively, are     If we use Equation with and , then we get     The proofs of the rules given in Equations through depend on the validity of extending theorems for real functions to their complex companions. Equation , for example, relies on Theorem .    If is differentiable at , then is continuous at .     From Equation , we obtain . Using the multiplicative property of limits given by Formula , we get .  This result implies that , which is equivalent to showing that is continuous at .   We can establish Equation from Theorem . Letting and using Definition 3.1, we write . If we subtract and add the term in the numerator, we get .  Using the definition of the derivative given by Equation and the continuity of , we obtain , which is what we wanted to establish. We leave the proofs of the other rules as exercises.  The rule for differentiating polynomials carries over to the complex case as well. If we let be a polynomial of degree , so . then mathematical induction, along with Equations and , gives . Again, we leave the proof of this result as an exercise.  We can use the differentiation rules as aids in determining when functions are analytic. For example, Equation tells us that if and are polynomials, then their quotient is analytic at all points where . This condition implies that the function is analytic for all . The square root function is more complicated. If , then is analytic at all points except (because is undefined) and at points that lie along the negative axis. The argument function, and therefore the function itself, are not continuous at points that lie along the negative axis.

  "title": "The Cauchy-Riemann Equations",
  "body": " The Cauchy-Riemann Equations  In Section 3.1 we showed that computing the derivative of complex functions written in a form such as is a rather simple task. But life isn't always so easy. Many times we encounter complex functions written in the form of . For example, suppose we had .  Is there some criterion that we can use to determine whether is differentiable, and if so, to find the value of ?  The answer to this question is yes , thanks to the independent discovery of two important equations by the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy A.L. Cauchy (1789 1857) played a prominent role in the development of complex analysis, and his name appears often throughout this text. The last name is not pronounced as kaushee. The first syllable has a long o sound, like the word kosher, but with the second syllable having a long e instead of er at the end. Thus, we pronounce Cauchy as kōsh\\={e}. In mathematical circles it is not kosher to mispronounce Cauchy! and the German mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann.  First, let's reconsider the derivative of . As we have stated, the limit given in Equation must not depend on how approaches . We investigate two such approaches: a horizontal approach and a vertical approach to . Recall from our graphical analysis of that the image of a square is a curvilinear quadrilateral. For convenience, we let the square have vertices , , , and . Then the image points are , , , and , as shown in Figure .   The image of a small square with vertex { }, using    We know that is differentiable, so the limit of the difference quotient exists no matter how we approach . Thus we can approximate  by using horizontal or vertical increments in : and . These computations lead to the idea of taking limits along the horizontal and vertical directions. When we do so, we get and   We now generalize this idea by taking limits of an arbitrary differentiable complex function and obtain an important result.   Cauchy-Riemann equations   Suppose that is differentiable at the point . Then the partial derivatives of and exist at the point , and .  Equating the real and imaginary parts of Equations and gives .     Because is differentiable, we know that exists regardless of the path we take as . We will choose horizontal and vertical lines that pass through the point and compute the limiting values of along these lines. Equating the two resulting limits will yield Equations . For the horizontal approach to , we set and obtain .  The last two limits are the partial derivatives of and with respect to , so . giving us Equation .  Along the vertical approach to , we have , so .  The last two limits are the partial derivatives of and with respect to , so . giving us Equation .  Since is differentiable at , the limits given by Equations and must be equal. If we equate the real and imaginary parts in those equations, the result is Equations , and the proof is complete.   Note some of the important implications of this theorem.   If is differentiable at , then the Cauchy-Riemann Equations will be satisfied at , and we can use either Equation  or to evaluate .    Taking the contrapositive, if Equations are not satisfied at , then we know automatically that  is not differentiable at .    If Equations  are satisfied at , however, we cannot necessarily conclude that is differentiable at .     We now illustrate each of these points.    We know that is differentiable and that . We also have . It is easy to verify that Equations are indeed satisfied: . Using Equations and , respectively, to compute gives , as expected.      Show that is nowhere differentiable.    We have , where and . Thus, for any point , and . The Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied at any point , so we conclude that is nowhere differentiable.      Show that the function defined by is not differentiable at the point even though the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied at .    We must use limits to calculate the partial derivatives at . .  Similarly, we can show that .  Hence the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold at the point .  We now show that is not differentiable at . Letting approach along the axis gives .  But if we let approach along the line given by the parametric equations and , then .  The two limits are distinct, so is not differentiable at the origin.     Example reiterates that the mere satisfaction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations is not sufficient to guarantee the differentiability of a function. The following theorem, however, gives conditions that guarantee the differentiability of at , so that which we can use either Equation or to compute . They are referred to as the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for differentiability.   Cauchy-Riemann conditions for differentiability   Let be a continuous function that is defined in some neighborhood of the point . If all the partial derivatives and are continuous at the point , and if the Cauchy-Riemann equations and hold at , then is differentiable at , and can be computed with either Equation or .     Let and , and let be small enough so that lies in the -neighborhood of in which the hypotheses hold. We need to show that approaches the limit given in Equation as approaches zero. We write the difference, , as   If we subtract and add the term , then we get .  The partial derivatives and exist, so the mean value theorem for real functions of two variables implies that a value exists between and such that we can write the first term in brackets on the right side of Equation as . Furthermore, as and are continuous at , there exists a quantity such that . where as and . Because forces , we can use the equation . where as and . Similarly, there exists a quantity such that the second term in brackets on the right side of Equation satisfies the equation . where as and . Combining Equations and gives . where partial derivatives and are evaluated at the point and and tend to zero as and both tend to zero. Similarly, the change is related to the changes and by the equation , where the partial derivatives and are evaluated at the point and and tend to zero as and both tend to zero. Combining these last two equations gives .  We can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations in Equation to obtain   Now we rearrange the terms and get   Since , we can divide both sides of this equation by and take the limit as : .  Because tends to zero as and both tend to zero, we have .  Similarly, the limits of the other quantities in Equation involving , , are zero. Therefore the limit in Equation becomes , which completes the proof of the theorem.     At the beginning of this section (Equation ) we defined the function . Show that this function is differentiable for all , and find its derivative.    We compute and , so the Cauchy-Riemann Equations are satisfied. Moreover, , and are continuous everywhere. By Theorem , is differentiable everywhere, and Equation gives .  Alternatively, from Equation , .    This result isn't surprising because and so the function is really our old friend .    Show that the function is differentiable for all and find its derivative.    We first write and and then compute the partial derivatives. .  We note that , and are continuous functions and that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for all values of . Hence, using Equation , we write     The Cauchy-Riemann conditions are particularly useful in determining the set of points for which a function is differentiable.    Show that the function is differentiable on the and axes, but analytic nowhere.    Recall ( Definition ) that when we say a function is analytic at a point we mean that the function is differentiable not only at , but also at every point in some -neighborhood of . With this in mind, we proceed to determine where the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied. We write and and compute the partial derivatives: .  Here , and are continuous, and holds for all . But iff , which is equivalent to . The Cauchy-Riemann equations hold only when or , and according to Theorem , is differentiable only at points that lie on the coordinate axes. But this means that is nowhere analytic because any -neighborhood about a point on either axis contains points that are not on those axes.    When polar coordinates are used to locate points in the plane, we use Expression for a complex function for convenience; that is, . where and are real functions of the real variables and . The polar form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations and a formula for finding in terms of the partial derivatives of and are given in Theorem , which we ask you to prove in Exercise . This theorem makes use of the validity of the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the functions and , so the relation between them and the functions and namely, and is important.   Polar form   Let be a continuous function that is defined in some neighborhood of the point . If all the partial derivatives and are continuous at the point and if the polar form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, , holds, then is differentiable at and we can compute the derivative by using either of the following formulas: .      Show that, if is given by . where the domain is restricted to be , then the derivative is given by , for every point in the domain.    Write . Then .  Since , and are continuous at every point in the domain (note the strict inequality in ), we use Theorem and Equation to get .  Note that is discontinuous on the negative real axis and is undefined at the origin. Using the terminology of Section , the negative real axis is a branch cut, and the origin is a branch point for this function.    Two important consequences of the Cauchy-Riemann equations close this section.    Let be an analytic function on the domain . Suppose for all that , where is a constant. Then is constant on .     The equation implies that, for all , .  If , then it must be that and for all , so is identically zero on . If , then we take the partial derivative of both sides of Equation with respect to both and , resulting in . where for brevity we write in place of , and so on. We can now use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to rewrite this system as .  Treating and as coefficients, we have two equations with two unknowns, and . Solving for and gives .  Note that it is important here for in Equation .  A theorem from the calculus of real functions states that, if for all we have both and , then for all , where is a constant. Using a similar argument, we find that , for all , and therefore , for all . In other words, is constant on .     Let be an analytic function in the domain . If for all in , then is constant in .     By the Cauchy-Riemann equations, for all . By hypothesis for all , so for all the functions , and are identically zero. As with the conclusion to the proof of Theorem , this situation means both and are constant functions, from whence the result follows.    Exercises   Use the Cauchy Riemann conditions to determine where the following functions are differentiable, and evaluate the derivatives at those points where they exist.   .   .

Determine where the following functions are differentiable and where they are analytic. Explain!   .   is differentiable only at points on the coordinate axes, so is nowhere analytic.    .   .   is differentiable and analytic inside quadrants I and III.     Let and be analytic functions in the domain . If for all in , then show that , where is a complex constant.    Explain how the limit definition for the derivative in complex analysis and the limit definition for the derivative in calculus are different. How are they similar?   The form of the definition is identical, but the meaning is more subtle in the complex case. For starters, the limit must exist when from any direction in the complex case. The real case is limited to two directions.    Let be an analytic function in the domain . Show that if at all points in , then is constant in .    Let be a nonconstant analytic function in the domain . Show that the function is not analytic in .   Since is analytic, and must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Since is not constant, this means the functions and do not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Explain why this is the case, and then use Theorem to conclude that is not analytic.    Recall that, for , and .  Temporarily, think of and as dummy symbols for real variables. With this perspective, and can be viewed as functions of and . Use the chain rule for a function of two variables to show that .  Now define the operator that is suggested by the previous equation. With this construct, show that if is differentiable at , then, at the point . Equating real and imaginary parts thus gives the complex form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations: .    "

  "body": " Harmonic Functions  Let be a real-valued function of the two real variables and defined on a domain . (Recall that a domain is a connected open set.) The partial differential equation is known as Laplace's equation (sometimes referred to as the potential equation). If , and are all continuous, and if satisfies Laplace's equation, then is harmonic on . Harmonic functions are important in applied mathematics, engineering, and mathematical physics. They are used to solve problems involving steady state temperatures, two-dimensional electrostatics, and ideal fluid flow. In Chapter we describe how complex analysis techniques can be used to solve some problems involving harmonic functions. We begin with an important theorem relating analytic and harmonic functions.     Let be an analytic function on a domain . Then both and are harmonic functions on . In other words, the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic.     In Corollary 6.3 we will show that, if is analytic, then all partial derivatives of and are continuous. Using that result here, we see that, as is analytic, and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations . Taking the partial derivative with respect to of each side of these equations gives . Similarly, taking the partial derivative of each side with respect to yields . The partial derivatives , , , and are all continuous, so we use a theorem from the calculus of real functions that states that the mixed partial derivatives are equal; that is, . Combining all these results finally gives , and . Therefore both and are harmonic functions on .   If we have a function that is harmonic on the domain and if we can find another harmonic function such that the partial derivatives for and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations throughout , then we say that is a harmonic conjugate of . It then follows that the function is analytic on .    If , then ; hence is a harmonic function for all . We find that is also a harmonic function and that . Therefore is a harmonic conjugate of , and the function given by is an analytic function.     Theorem makes the construction of harmonic functions from known analytic functions an easy task.    The function is analytic for all values of . Hence it follows that is harmonic for all , and that is a harmonic conjugate of .     Figures and show the graphs of these two functions. The partial derivatives are , and . They satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations because they are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function. At the point , we have , and these partial derivatives appear along the edges of the surfaces for and where and . Similarly, and also appear along the edges of the surfaces for and where and .       {0.5\\textwidth}   We can use complex analysis to show easily that certain combinations of harmonic functions are harmonic. For example, if is a harmonic conjugate of , then their product is a harmonic function. This condition can be verified directly by computing the partial derivatives and showing that Equation holds, but the details are tedious. If we use complex variable techniques instead, we can start with the fact that is an analytic function. Then we observe that the square of is also an analytic function:   We then know immediately that the imaginary part, , is a harmonic function by Theorem . A constant multiple of a harmonic function is harmonic, so it follows that is harmonic. We leave as an exercise to show that, if and are two harmonic functions that are not related in the preceding fashion, then their product need not be harmonic.   Construction of a harmonic conjugate   Let be harmonic in an -neighborhood of the point . Then there exists a conjugate harmonic function defined in this neighborhood such that is an analytic function.     A conjugate harmonic function will satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and . Assuming that such a function exists, we determine what it would have to look like by using a two-step process. First, we integrate (which should equal ) with respect to and get . where is a function of alone that is yet to be determined. Second, we compute by differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to and replacing with on the left side, which gives . It can be shown (we omit the details) that because is harmonic, all terms except those involving in the last equation will cancel, revealing a formula for involving alone. Elementary integration of the single-variable function can then be used to discover . We finally observe that the function so created indeed has the properties we seek.   Technically we should always specify the domain of function when defining it. When no such specification is given, it is assumed that the domain is the entire complex plane, or the largest set for which the expression defining the function makes sense.    Show that is a harmonic function and find a conjugate harmonic function .    We follow the construction process of Theorem . The first partial derivatives are .  To verify that is harmonic, we compute the second partial derivatives and note that , so satisfies Laplace's Equation . To construct , we start with Equation and the first of Equations to get . Differentiating the left and right sides of this equation with respect to and using and Equations on the left side yields . which implies that .  Finally, if we integrate this equation we get     Harmonic functions arise as solutions to many physical problems. Applications include two-dimensional models of heat flow, electrostatics, and fluid flow. We now give an example of the latter.  We assume that an incompressible and frictionless fluid flows over the complex plane and that all cross sections in planes parallel to the complex plane are the same. Situations such as this occur when fluid is flowing in a deep channel. The velocity vector at the point is , which we illustrate in Figure .   The vector field , which can be considered as a fluid flow    The assumption that the flow is irrotational and has no sources or sinks implies that both the curl and divergence vanish; that is, and . Hence and obey the equations .  Equations are similar to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and permit us to define a special complex function: .  Here we have , and . We can use Equations to verify that the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold for : .  Assuming that the functions and have continuous partials, Theorem guarantees that function defined in Equation is analytic and that the fluid flow of Equation is the conjugate of an analytic function; that is,   In we prove that every analytic function has an analytic antiderivative ; assuming this to be the case, we can write . where .   Theorem implies that is a harmonic function. Using the vector interpretation of a complex number, the gradient of can be written as   The Cauchy-Riemann equations applied to give . Making this substitution in the preceding equation yields   Equation says that , which by the preceding equation and Equation implies that   Finally, from Equation  is the scalar potential function for the fluid flow, so   The curves given by are called equipotentials . The curves are called streamlines and describe the path of fluid flow. In Section we show that the family of equipotentials is orthogonal to the family of streamlines, as depicted in Figure .   The families of orthogonal curves and for the function      Show that the harmonic function is the scalar potential function for the fluid flow expression .

  "title": "Sequences and Series",
  "body": " Sequences and Series  In formal terms, a complex sequence is a function whose domain is the positive integers and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers. The following are examples of sequences: .  For convenience, at times we use the term sequence rather than complex sequence. If we want a function to represent an arbitrary sequence, we can specify it by writing , and so on. The values , are called the terms of a sequence, and mathematicians, being generally lazy when it comes to such things, often refer to as the sequence itself, even though they are really speaking of the range of the sequence when they do so. You will usually see a sequence written as , or, when the indices are understood, as . Mathematicians are also not so fussy about starting a sequence at so that , , would also be acceptable notation provided all terms were defined. For example, the sequence given by Equation could be written in a variety of ways:   The sequences and given by Equations and behave differently as gets larger. The terms in Equation approach , but those in Equation do not approach any particular number, as they oscillate around the eight eighth roots of unity on the unit circle. Informally, the sequence has as its limit as approaches infinity, provided the terms can be made as close as we want to by making large enough. When this happens, we write .  If , we say that the sequence converges to .  We need a rigorous definition for Statement , however, if we are to do honest mathematics.   Limit of a Sequence    means that for any real number there corresponds a positive integer (which depends on ) such that whenever . That is, whenever .     The reason that we use the notation is to emphasize the fact that this number depends on our choice of . Sometimes, for convenience, we drop the subscript.    Figure illustrates a convergent sequence.   A sequence that converges to    In form, Definition is exactly the same as the corresponding definition for limits of real sequences. In fact, a simple criterion casts the convergence of complex sequences in terms of the convergence of real sequences.    Let and . Then,      First we assume that Statement is true and then deduce the truth of Statement . Let be an arbitrary positive real number. To establish Statement , we must show (1) that there is a positive integer such that the inequality holds whenever and (2) that there is a positive integer such that the inequality holds whenever . Because we are assuming Statement to be true, we know (according to Definition ) that there is a positive integer such that if . Recall that is equivalent to the inequality . Thus, whenever , we have .  Similarly, we can show that there is a number such that whenever , which proves Statement .  To complete the proof of this theorem, we must show that the conditions of Statement imply Statement . Let be an arbitrary real number. By Statement , there exist positive integers and such that .  Let  ; then, if ,    We needed to show the strict inequality , and the next-to-last line in the proof gives us precisely that. Note also that we have been speaking of the limit of a sequence. Strictly speaking, we are not entitled to use this terminology because we haven't proved that a complex sequence can have only one limit. The proof, however, is almost identical to the corresponding result for real sequences, and we leave it as an exercise.    Find if .    We write . Using results concerning sequences of real numbers, we find that and . Therefore, .      Show that diverges.    We have .  The real sequences and both diverge, so we conclude that the sequence diverges.     Bounded Sequence   A complex sequence is bounded provided that there exists a positive real number and an integer such that for all . In other words, for , the sequence is contained in the disk .    Bounded sequences play an important role in some newer developments in complex analysis that are discussed in Section . A theorem from real analysis stipulates that convergent sequences are bounded. The same result holds for complex sequences.    If is a convergent sequence, then is bounded.     The proof is left as an exercise.   As with the real numbers, we also have the following definition.   Cauchy Sequence   The sequence is a Cauchy sequence if for every there is a positive integer \\ such that if , then , or, equivalently, .    The following theorem should now come as no surprise.    If is a Cauchy sequence, converges.     Let . Using the techniques of Theorem , we can easily show that both and are Cauchy sequences of real numbers. Since Cauchy sequences of real numbers are convergent, we know that for some real numbers and . By Theorem , then, , where . In other words, the sequence converges to .   One of the most important notions in analysis (real or complex) is a theory that allows us to add up infinitely many terms. To make sense of such an idea we begin with a sequence , and form a new sequence , called the sequence of partial sums, as follows.    Infinite Series   The formal expression is called an infinite series, and are called the terms of the series.     Convergent Series   If there is a complex number for which , we say that the infinite series converges to , and that is the sum of the infinite series. When convergence occurs, we write .     Absolutely Convergent Series   The series is said to be absolutely convergent provided that the (real) series of magnitudes converges.     Divergent Series   If a series does not converge, we say that it diverges.     The first finitely many terms of a series do not affect its convergence or divergence and, in this respect, the beginning index of a series is irrelevant. Thus, we will without comment conclude that if a series converges, then so does , where is any finite collection of terms. A similar remark applies to determining divergence of a series.   As you might expect, many of the results concerning real series carry over to complex series. We now give several of the more standard theorems for complex series, along with examples of how they are used.    Let and . Then .     Let , , and . We use Theorem to conclude that iff both and . The completion of the proof now follows from Definition .     If is a convergent complex series, then .     The proof is left as an exercise.     Show that the series is convergent.    Recall that the real series and are convergent. Hence, Theorem implies that the given complex series is convergent.      Show that the series is divergent.    We know that the real series is divergent. Hence, Theorem implies that the given complex series is divergent.      Show that the series is divergent.    Here we set and observe that . Thus , and Theorem implies that the series is not convergent; hence it is divergent.      Let and be convergent series and let be a complex number. Then .     The proof is left as an exercise.    Cauchy Product   Let and be convergent series, where and are complex numbers. The Cauchy product of the two series is defined to be the series , where .      If the Cauchy product converges, then      The proof can be found in a number of texts for example, Infinite Sequences and Series, by Konrad Knopp (translated by Frederick Bagemihl; New York: Dover, 1956).    Comparison test   Let be a convergent series of real nonnegative terms. If is a sequence of complex numbers and holds for all , then the infinite series converges.     Using Equations , we determine that and holds for all . By the comparison test for real series, we conclude that and are convergent. An absolutely convergent real series is convergent, so and are convergent. With these results, together with Theorem , we conclude that the infinite series is convergent.     If converges, then converges. In other words, absolute convergence implies convergence for complex series as well as for real series.     The proof is left as an exercise.     Show that converges.    We calculate . Using the comparison test and the fact that converges, we determine that converges, and hence so does .     Exercises   Find the following limits.   .   .    .   .   .    .    Show that , where is the principal value of the th root of .    Suppose that . Show that .   Let be given. Since , there exists such that if then , i.e. , . But since , we see that if , then .

  "title": "Julia and Mandelbrot Sets",
  "body": " Julia and Mandelbrot Sets  An impetus for studying complex analysis is the comparison of properties of real numbers and functions with their complex counterparts. In this section we take a look at Newton's method for finding solutions to the equation . Then, by examining the more general topic of iteration, we will plunge into a breathtaking world of color and imagination. The mathematics surrounding this topic has generated a great deal of popular attention in the past few years.  Recall from calculus that Newton's method proceeds by starting with a function and an initial guess of as a solution to . We then generate a new guess by the computation . Using in place of , this process is repeated, giving . We thus obtain a sequence of points , where . The points are called the iterates of . For functions defined on the real numbers, this method gives remarkably good results, and the sequence often converges to a solution of rather quickly. In the late 1800s, the British mathematician Arthur Cayley investigated the question of whether Newton's method can be applied to complex functions. He wrote a paper giving an analysis for how this method works for quadratic polynomials and indicated his intention to publish a subsequent paper for cubic polynomials. Unfortunately, Cayley died before producing this paper. As you will see, the extension of Newton's method to the complex domain and the more general question of iteration are quite complicated.    Trace the next five iterates of Newton's method for an initial guess of as a solution to the equation , where .    For any guess for a solution, Newton's method gives as the next guess the number . Table gives the iterates, rounded to five decimal places.   Figure shows the relative positions of these points on the plane. Note that the points and are so close together that they appear to coincide, and that the value for agrees to five decimal places with the actual solution .     The iterates of { { }} for Newton's method applied to { { }}     The iterates of { { }} for Newton's method applied to    The complex version of Newton's method also appears to work quite well. Recall, however, that with functions defined on the reals, not every initial guess produces a sequence that converges to a solution. Example shows that the same is true in the complex case.    Show that Newton's method fails for the function if the initial guess is a real number.    From Example we know that, for any guess as a solution of , the next guess at a solution is . We let be any real number and be the sequence of iterations produced by the initial seed . If for any , , the procedure terminates, as will be undefined. If all the terms of the sequence are defined, an easy induction argument shows that all the terms of the sequence are real. Because the solutions of are , the sequence cannot possibly converge to either solution. In the exercises we ask you to explore in detail what happens when is in the upper or lower half-plane.    The case for cubic polynomials is more complicated than that for quadratics. Fortunately, we can get an idea of what's going on by doing some experimentation with computer graphics. We begin with the cubic polynomial . (Recall that the roots of this polynomial are at , and .) We associate a color with each root (blue, red, and green, respectively). We form a rectangular region , which contains the three roots of , and partition this region into equal rectangles . We then choose a point at the center of each rectangle and for each of these points we apply the following algorithm.   With , compute . Continue computing successive iterates of this initial point until we either are within a certain preassigned tolerance (say, ) of one of the roots of , or until the number of iterations has exceeded a preassigned maximum.    If Step 1 leaves us within of one of the roots of , we color the entire rectangle with the color associated with that root. Otherwise, we assume that the initial point does not converge to any root, and we color the entire rectangle yellow.     Note that this algorithm doesn't prove anything. In Step 2, there is no a priori reason to justify the assumption mentioned, nor is there any necessity for an initial point to have its sequence of iterates converging to one of the roots of just because a particular iteration is within of that root. Finally, the fact that one point in a rectangle behaves in a certain way does not imply that all the points in that rectangle behave in a like manner. Nevertheless, we can use this algorithm as a basis for mathematical explorations. Indeed, computer experiments such as the one described have contributed to a lot of exciting mathematics during the past 30 years. Figure shows the results for the cubic polynomial .  The points in the blue, red, and green regions are those initial guesses that will converge to the roots , , and , respectively. (The roots themselves are located in the middle of the three largest colored regions.) The complexity of this picture becomes apparent when you observe that, wherever two colors appear to meet, the third color emerges between them. But then, a closer inspection of the area where this third color meets one of the other colors reveals again a different color between them. This process continues with an infinite complexity.  There appear to be no yellow regions with any area in Figure , indicating that at least most initial guesses at a solution to will produce a sequence that converges to one of the three roots. Figure demonstrates that this outcome does not always occur. It shows the results of applying the preceding algorithm to the polynomial .       \\hspace{\\fill} \\caption{Newton's method applied to two different cubics}  The yellow area shown is often referred to as the rabbit . It consists of a main body and two ears, and is an example of a fractal image . Mathematicians use the term fractal to indicate an object that is self-similar and infinitely replicating. Figure illustrates this phenomenon by zooming in on a portion of Figure . You can see that each of the ears consists of a main body and two ears, and so on.   A zoom of the rabbit    In 1918, the French mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou noticed this fractal phenomenon when exploring iterations of functions not necessarily connected with Newton's method. Beginning with a function and a point , they computed the iterates and investigated properties of the sequence . Their findings did not receive a great deal of attention, largely because computer graphics were not available at that time. With the recent proliferation of computers, it is not surprising that these investigations were revived in the 1980s. Detailed studies of Newton's method and the more general topic of iteration were undertaken by a host of mathematicians including Curry, Devaney, Douady, Garnett, Hubbard, Mandelbrot, Milnor, and Sullivan. We now turn our attention to some of their results by focusing on the iterations produced by quadratics of the form . You will be surprised at the startling pictures that graphical iterates of such a simple function produce.    For , analyze all possible iterations when , that is, for the function defined by .    We leave as an exercise the claim that, if , the sequence will converge to 0; if , the sequence will be unbounded; and if , the sequence will either oscillate around the unit circle or converge to 1.    For the function , defined by , and an initial seed , the set of iterates given by , , is also called the orbit of generated by . We let denote the set of points with a bounded orbit for . Example 4.9 shows that is the closed unit disk . The boundary of is known as the Julia set for the function . Thus the Julia set for is the unit circle . It turns out that is a nice simple set only when or ; otherwise, is fractal. Figure shows . The variation in colors indicate the length of time it takes for points to become sufficiently unbounded according to the following algorithm, which uses the same notation as our algorithm for iterations via Newton's method. It has reminded some of St. Mark's square in Venice when flooding occurs.   Compute . Continue computing successive iterates of this initial point until the absolute value of one of the iterations exceeds a certain bound (say, ), or until the number of iterations has exceeded a preassigned maximum.    If Step 1 leaves us with an iteration whose absolute value exceeds , we color the entire rectangle with a color indicating the number of iterations needed before this value was attained (the more iterations required, the darker the color). Otherwise, we assume that the orbit of the initial point do not diverge to infinity, and we color the entire rectangle black.     Note, again, that this algorithm doesn't prove anything. It merely guides the direction of our efforts to do rigorous mathematics.   Figure shows the Julia set for the function , where . The boundary of this set is different from the boundaries of the other sets we have seen, in that it is disconnected. Julia and Fatou independently discovered a simple criterion that can be used to tell when the Julia set for is connected or disconnected. We state their result, but omit the proof, as it is beyond the scope of this text.       \\hspace{\\fill} \\caption{Results of iterating for two different values of }    The boundary of is connected if and only if . In other words, the Julia set for is connected if and only if the orbit of 0 is bounded.      Show that the Julia set for is connected.    We apply Theorem and compute the orbit of 0 for . We have , , , and . Thus the orbit of 0 are the sequence , which is clearly a bounded sequence. Thus, by Theorem , the Julia set for is connected.    In 1980, the Polish-born mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot used computer graphics to study the set .  The set is known as the Mandelbrot set . Figure shows its intricate nature.   The Mandelbrot set    Technically, the Mandelbrot set is not fractal because it is not self-similar (although it may look that way). However, it is infinitely complex. Figure shows a zoom over the upper portion of the set shown in Figure . Likewise, Figure zooms in on the upper portion of Figure . In Figure you can see the emergence of another structure very similar to the Mandelbrot set that we began with. Although it isn't an exact replica, if you zoomed in on this set at almost any spot, you would eventually see yet another Mandelbrot clone and so on ad infinitum! In the remainder of this section we look at some of the properties of this amazing set.   A zoom of the upper-portion of Figure     A zoom of the upper-portion of Figure \\hspace{\\fill} \\caption{Zooming in on the Mandelbrot set}    Show that .    Let be the orbit of 0 generated by , where . Then .  We show that is bounded, and, in particular, we show that for all by mathematical induction. Clearly if or 1. We assume that for some value of (our goal is to show ). Now, .    In the exercises, we ask you to show that, if , then . Thus the Mandelbrot set depicted in Figure contains the disk and is contained in the disk .  We can use other methods to determine which points belong to . To do so, we need some additional vocabulary.   Fixed Point   The point is a fixed point for the function if .     Attracting Point   The point is an attracting point for the function if .     Theorem explains the significance of these terms.    Suppose that is an attracting fixed point for the function . Then there is a disk about such that the iterates of all the points in are drawn toward in the sense that, if , then . In fact, if is the th iterate of , then .     Because is an attracting point for , we know that . And because is differentiable at , we know that for any there exists some such that if , then . If we set , then we have for all in that , which gives . Thus . Because is a fixed point for , this last inequality implies that , which is the first part of our theorem.  The proof that is left as an exercise.   In 1905, Fatou showed that, if the function defined by has attracting fixed points, then the orbit of 0 determined by must converge to one of them. Because a convergent sequence is bounded, this condition implies that must belong to . In the exercises we ask you to show that the main cardioid-shaped body of in Figure is composed of those points for which has attracting fixed points. You will find Theorem to be a useful characterization of these points.    The function has attracting fixed points iff or , where the square root designates the principal square root function.     The point is a fixed point for iff . In other words, iff . By Theorem , the solutions to this equation are , where again the square root designates the principal square root function. Now, is an attracting point iff . Combining this result with the solutions for gives our desired result.    $n$-cycle   An -cycle for a function is a set of complex numbers such that , for and .     Attracting   An n-cycle for a function is said to be attracting if , where is the composition of with itself times. For example, if , then .       Example shows that is a 2-cycle for the function . It is not an attracting 2-cycle because and . Hence , so .    In the exercises, we ask you to show that, if is an attracting -cycle for a function , then not only does satisfy , but also that , for .  One can prove that the large disk to the left of the cardioid in Figure consists of those points for which has a 2-cycle. The large disks above and below the main cardioid disk are the points for which has a 3-cycle.  Continuing with this scheme, we see that the idea of -cycles explains the appearance of the buds that you see on Figure . It does not, however, begin to do justice to the enormous complexity of the entire set. Even Figures and are mere glimpses into its awesome beauty.   Exercises   Consider the function , where   Show that, if , the sequence formed by successive iterations of via lies entirely within the upper half-plane.  If , show . The result now follows explain why!   Show that a similar result holds if .  Use induction to show that, if all the terms of the sequence are defined, then the sequence is real, provided is real.  If is real then obviously is real. Assume is real for some . Then is also real, provided .   Discuss whether converges to if and to if .    Formulate and solve problems analogous to those in Exercise 1 for the function .    Prove that Newton's method always works for polynomials having degree 1 (functions of the form , where ). How many iterations are necessary before Newton's method produces the solution to ?   For , if our initial guess is , then . But this is the solution to the equation , so our iteration either stops here or with (if by chance we had set ).    Consider the function and an initial point . Let be the sequence of iterates of generated by . That is, , and so on.  Show that, if , the sequence converges to 0.  Show that, if , the sequence is unbounded.  Show that, if , the sequence either converges to 1 or oscillates around the unit circle. Give a simple criterion that you can apply to that will reveal which of these two paths takes.    Show that the Julia set for is connected.   The Julia set for is connected by Theorem because the orbit of 0 under is , which is a bounded set.    Determine the precise structure of the set .    Prove that if a complex number is in the Mandelbrot set, then its conjugate is also in the Mandelbrot set. Thus, the Mandelbrot set is symmetric about the axis. \\hint{Use mathematical induction.}   Suppose , and let be the orbit of 0 under . By definition of , there is some real number such that for all . Let be the orbit of 0 under . Show by induction that for all . Once you have that, it is straight forward to conclude that the set is bounded.    Show that, if is any real number greater than , then is not in the Mandelbrot set. Note : Combining this condition with Example shows that the cusp in the cardioid section of the Mandelbrot set occurs precisely at .    Find a value for that is in the Mandelbrot set such that its negative, , is not in the Mandelbrot set.   There are many examples. The number , is in the Mandelbrot set, but its negative, , is not. Whether you use this example or not, justify your assertion!    Show that the points that solve the inequalities of Theorem form a cardioid. This cardioid is the main body of the Mandelbrot set shown in Figure . \\hint{It may be helpful to write the inequalities of Theorem as     Use Theorem and the paragraph immediately before it to show that the point belongs to the Mandelbrot set.

If then for all ,      This result follows immediately from Equation .     Show that .    If we set , then . By Theorem , the sum is       Evaluate .    We can put this expression in the form of a geometric series: .     The equalities given in Example collectively illustrate an important point with regard to evaluating a geometric series whose beginning index is other than zero. The value of equals . If we think of as the ratio by which any term of the series is multiplied to generate successive terms, we note that the sum of a geometric series equals , provided .   The geometric series is used in the proof of Theorem , which is known as the ratio test . It is one of the most commonly used tests for determining the convergence or divergence of series. The proof is similar to the one used for real series, and we leave it for you to do.   d'Alembert's ratio test   If is a complex series with the property that , then the series is absolutely convergent if and divergent if .      Show that converges.    Using the ratio test, we find that .  Because , the series converges.      Show that the series converges for all values of in the disk and diverges if .    Using the ratio test, we see that . If , then , and the series converges. If , then , and the series diverges.    Our next result, known as the root test, is slightly more powerful than the ratio test. Before we present this test, we need to discuss a rather sophisticated idea used with it the limit supremum.    Limit Supremum   Let be a sequence of positive real numbers. The limit supremum of the sequence (denoted is the smallest real number having the property that for any , there are at most finitely many terms in the sequence that are larger than . If there is no such number , then .      \\textrm{} The limit supremum of the sequence , because if we set , then for any , there are only finitely many terms in the sequence larger than . Additionally, if is smaller than 5, then by setting , we can find infinitely many terms in the sequence larger than (because .      The limit supremum of the sequence , because if we set , then for any , there are only finitely many terms (actually, there are none) in the sequence larger than . Additionally, if is smaller than 3, then by setting we can find infinitely many terms in the sequence larger than (because , as the following calculation shows: .      The limit supremum of the Fibonacci sequence . (The Fibonacci sequence satisfies the relation for .)    The limit supremum is a powerful idea because the limit supremum of a sequence always exists, which is not true for the ordinary limit. However, Example illustrates the fact that, if the limit of a sequence does exist, then it will be the same as the limit supremum.    The sequence .  We leave verification of this as an exercise.     Root test   Suppose the series has . Then the series is absolutely convergent if and divergent if .     Suppose first that . We can select a number such that . By definition of the limit supremum, only finitely many terms in the sequence exceed , so there exists a positive integer such that for all we have . That is, for all . For , Theorem implies that converges. But then Theorem implies that converges, and hence so does . Corollary then guarantees that converges.  Now suppose that . We can select a number such that . Again, by definition of the limit supremum we conclude that for infinitely many . But this condition means that for infinitely many , and as , this implies that does not converge to 0. By Theorem , does not converge.   Note that, in applying either Theorem  or , if the convergence or divergence of the series is unknown, and further analysis is required to determine the true state of affairs.   Exercises   Evaluate   .  By Theorem , (show the details), since (show this also).    .    Show that converges for all values of in the disk and diverges if .    Is the series convergent?

  "body": " Power Series Functions  Suppose that we have a series , where . If and the collection of are fixed complex numbers, we get different series by selecting different values for . For example, if and for all , we get the series if and if . Note that, when and for all , we get the geometric series. The collection of points for which the series converges is the domain of a function , which we call a power series function. Technically, this series is undefined if and because is undefined. We get around this difficulty by stipulating that the series is really compact notation for . In this section we present some results that are useful in helping establish properties of functions defined by power series.    Suppose that . Then the set of points for which the series converges is one of the following:   i  the single point ;    ii  the disk , along with part (either none, some, or all) of the circle ;    iii  the entire complex plane.        By Theorem , the series converges absolutely at those values of for which . This condition is the same as requiring .  There are three possibilities to consider for the value of . If the limit supremum equals , Inequality holds iff , which is case ( i ). If , Inequality holds iff \\Big( i.e. , iff , where \\Big) which is case ( ii ). Finally, if the limit supremum equals 0, the left side of Inequality will be 0 for any value of , which is case ( iii ). We are unable to say for sure what happens with respect to convergence on . You will see in the exercises that there are various possibilities.   Another way to phrase case ( ii ) of Theorem is to say that the power series converges if and diverges if . We call the number the radius of convergence of the power series (see Figure ). For case ( i ) of Theorem , we say that the radius of convergence is zero and that the radius of convergence is infinity for case ( iii ).   The radius of convergence of a power series      For the power series function we can find , its radius of convergence, by any of the following methods:   i  Cauchy 's root test: (provided the limit exists).    ii  Cauchy-Hadamard formula: (this limit always exists).    iii  d'Alembert's ratio test: (provided the limit exists).     We set if the limit equals 0 and if the limit equals .     If you examine carefully the proof of Theorem , you will see that we have already proved ( i ) and ( ii ). They follow directly from Inequality and the fact that the limit supremum equals the limit whenever the limit exists. We can show ( iii ) by using the ratio test. We leave the details as an exercise.   We now give an example illustrating each of these cases.    The series has radius of convergence 3 by Cauchy 's root test because .      The series has radius of convergence by the Cauchy-Hadamard formula because , so .      The series has radius of convergence by the ratio test because .    We come now to the main result of this section.     Suppose that the function has radius of convergence . Then   i   is infinitely differentiable for all . In fact    ii  for all , ; and    iii   , where denotes the th derivative of . (When , denotes the function itself so that for all .)        Remarkably, the entire proof hinges on verifying ( ii ) for the simple case when . The cases in ( ii ) for follow by induction. For instance, we get the case when by applying the result for to the series . Also, ( i ) is an automatic consequence of ( ii ), because ( ii ) gives a formula for computing derivatives of all orders in addition to assuring us of their existence. Finally, ( iii ) follows by setting in ( ii ), as all the terms drop out except when , giving us . Solving for gives the desired result.  Verifying ( ii ) when , however, is no simple task. We begin by defining the following: .  Here is simply the st partial sum of the series , and is the sum of the remaining terms of that series. We leave as an exercise to show that the radius of convergence for is , the same as that of . For a fixed , we must prove that ; that is, we must prove that . We do so by showing that for all there exists such that, if with , then .  Let and be given. Choose so that . We choose to be small enough so that (see Figure ) and also small enough to satisfy an additional restriction, which we shall specify in a moment.   Choosing to prove that    Because , simplifying the right side of the following equation reveals that for all , , where is the derivative of the function evaluated at . Equation has the general form . By the triangle inequality, , so our proof will be complete if we can show that for a small enough value of , each of the expressions , and is less than .   Calculation for :  , where the last inequality follows from Exercise , Section .  As an exercise, we ask you to show that .  Assuming the validity of this inequality, we then get .  Since , the series converges (can you explain why?). Thus the tail part of the series, which is the right side of Inequality , can certainly be made less than if we choose large enough say, .   Calculation for :   Since , it is clear that . Thus there is an integer such that if , then .   Calculation for :   We define . Because is a polynomial, exists. This means we can find small enough that it complies with the restriction previously placed on it as well as ensuring that whenever , with . Using this value of for in Equation , together with our chosen , yields conclusion ( ii ) and hence the entire theorem.     Show that for all .    We know from Theorem that for all . If we set in Theorem , part (ii), then , for all .      The Bessel function of order zero is defined by , and termwise differentiation shows that its derivative is . We leave as an exercise to show that the radius of convergence of these series is infinity. The Bessel function of order 1 is known to satisfy the differential equation .

  "title": "The Complex Exponential Function",
  "body": " The Complex Exponential Function  Recall that the real exponential function can be represented by the power series . Thus it is only natural to define the complex exponential , also written as ,in the following way.   The Complex Exponential      Clearly, this definition agrees with that of the real exponential function when is a real number. We now show that this complex exponential has two of the key properties associated with its real counterpart and verify the identity , which, back in Chapter (see Identity of Section ) we promised to establish.    The function is an entire function satisfying the following conditions.   i   (using Leibniz notation we write ).    ii   ( i.e. , ).    iii  If is a real number, then .        By the ratio test (check Example ), the series in Definition has an infinite radius of convergence, so is entire by Theorem , part (i).  Using Theorem , part (ii), we get , which gives us part (i) of Theorem   To prove part (ii), we let be an arbitrary complex number and define to be . Using the product rule, chain rule, and part (i), we have . According to Theorem , this result implies that the function must be constant. Thus, for all , . Since (verify!), we deduce . Hence, for all , . Setting and letting , we get , which simplifies to our desired result.  To prove part (iii), we let be a real number. By Definition , .   Note that parts (ii) and (iii) of the Theorem combine to verify DeMoivre's formula, which we introduced in Section see Identity . Further, if , we have .  Some texts start with Identity as the definition for . In the exercises, we show that this is a natural approach from the standpoint of differential equations.  The notation is preferred over in some situations. For example, the number is the value of when and equals the positive fifth root of . The notation , however, is ambiguous and might be interpreted as any of the complex fifth roots of the number that we discussed in Section : .  To prevent confusion, we often use to denote the single-valued exponential function.  We now explore some additional properties of . Using Identity it follows that .  For example, because Identity involves the periodic functions and , any two points in the plane that lie on the same vertical line with their imaginary parts differing by an integral multiple of are mapped onto the same point in the plane. Thus the complex exponential function is periodic with period , which establishes Equation . We leave the verification of Equations and as exercises.    For any integer , the points in the plane are mapped onto the single point in the plane, as indicated in Figure .     The points in the plane ( i.e. , the plane) and their image in the plane ( i.e. , the plane)    Let's look at the range of the exponential function. If , we see from Identity that can never equal zero, as is never zero, and the cosine and sine functions are never zero at the same point. Suppose, then, that . If we write in its exponential form as , Identity gives   Using Identity , and Property of Section , we get .  Solving Equations for and yields , where is an integer. Thus for any complex number , there are infinitely many complex numbers such that . From Equations , the numbers are . where is an integer. Hence   In summary, the transformation maps the complex plane (infinitely often) onto the set of nonzero complex numbers.  If we restrict the solutions to Equation so that only the principal value of the argument, , is used, the transformation maps the horizontal strip one-to-one and onto the range set . This strip is called the fundamental period strip and is shown in Figure .   The fundamental period strip for the mapping    The horizontal line , for in the plane, is mapped onto the ray that is inclined at an angle in the plane. The vertical segment , for in the plane, is mapped onto the circle centered at the origin with radius in the plane. That is, . The lines , , and , are mapped to the rays , , and , respectively. Likewise, the segments , , and are mapped to the corresponding circles , , and .    Consider a rectangle , where .

Then, by definition, .    The questions for this problem relate to Figure 5.2.

How are they similar?    Many texts give an alternative definition for , starting with Identity as the definition for . Recall that this identity states that . This exercise shows such a definition is a natural approach in terms of differential equations. We start by requiring to be the solution to an initial-value problem satisfying three conditions: (1) is entire, (2) for all , and (3) . Suppose that satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).  Use the result and the requirement from condition (2) to show that , for all .  Show that the result in part (a) implies that . This means is constant with respect to , so , where is a function of alone.  Using a similar procedure for , show we wind up getting a pair of solutions , and where and are functions of alone.  Now use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to conclude from part (c) that and .  Use part (d) to show that and .  Identify the general solutions to part (e). Then, given the initial conditions  , find the particular solutions and conclude that Identity follows.    "

  "body": " The Complex Logarithm  In Section , we showed that, if is a nonzero complex number, then the equation has infinitely many solutions. Because the function is a many-to-one function, its inverse (the logarithm) is necessarily multivalued.   Multivalued logarithm   For , we define the multivalued function as the inverse of the exponential function; that is, .    If we go through the same steps as we did in Equations and , we find that, for any complex number , the solutions to Equation take the form . where and denotes the natural logarithm of the positive number . Because is the set , we can express the set of values comprising as , where it is understood that Identity refers to the same set of numbers per Identity .  Recall that \\mathrm{Arg} is defined so that for , . We call any one of the values given in Identities or a logarithm of . Note that the different values of all have the same real part and that their imaginary parts differ by the amount , where is an integer. When , we have a special situation.   Principal value of the logarithm   For , we define Log, the principal value of the logarithm, by .    The domain for the function \\mathrm{Log} is the set of all nonzero complex numbers in the plane, and its range is the horizontal strip in the plane. We stress again that \\mathrm{Log} is a single-valued function and corresponds to setting in Equation . As we demonstrated in Chapter , the function \\mathrm{Arg} is discontinuous at each point along the negative axis; hence so is the function \\mathrm{Log}. In fact, because any branch of the multivalued function is discontinuous along some ray, a corresponding branch of the logarithm will have a discontinuity along that same ray.    Find the values of and .    By standard computations, we have .  The principal values are .    We now investigate some of the properties of and \\mathrm{Log}. From Equations , , and , it follows that , and that the mapping is one-to-one from domain in the plane onto the horizontal strip in the plane.  The following example illustrates that, even though \\textrm{Log} is not continuous along the negative real axis, it is still defined there.    Identity reveals that .    When , where is a positive real number, the principal value of the complex logarithm of is . where . Hence \\textrm{Log} is an extension of the real function to the complex case. Are there other similarities? Let's use complex function theory to find the derivative of \\textrm{Log} . When we use polar coordinates for , Equation becomes , where and . Because is discontinuous only at points in its domain that lie on the negative real axis, and have continuous partials for any point in their domain, provided is not on the negative real axis, that is, provided . (Note the strict inequality for here.) In addition, the polar form of the Cauchy-Riemann equations holds in this region (see Equation of Section ), since .  Using Theorem of Section , we see that . provided and . Thus the principal branch of the complex logarithm has the derivative we would expect. Other properties of the logarithm carry over, but only in specified regions of the complex plane.    Show that the identity is not always valid.    Let and . Then .    Our next result explains why didn't hold for the particular numbers we chose.    The identity holds true iff .     Suppose first that . By definition, . Because , it follows that (explain!), and so . The only if part is left as an exercise.   As Example and Theorem illustrate, properties of the complex logarithm don't carry over when arguments of products combine in such a way that they drop down to or rise above . This is because of the restrictions placed on the domain of the function \\mathrm{Arg}. From the set of numbers associated with the multivalued logarithm, however, we can formulate properties that look exactly the same as those corresponding with the real logarithm.    Let and be nonzero complex numbers. The multivalued function obeys the familiar properties of logarithms: .     Identity is easy to establish: Using Identity in Section concerning the argument of a product (and keeping in mind we are dealing with sets of numbers), we write .  Identities and are left as exercises.   We can construct many different branches of the multivalued logarithm function that are continuous and differentiable except at points along any preassigned ray . If we let denote a real fixed number and choose the value of that lies in the range , then the function defined by , where , and , is a single-valued branch of the logarithm function. The branch cut for is the ray , and each point along this ray is a point of discontinuity of . Because , we conclude that the mapping is a one-to-one mapping of the domain onto the horizontal strip . If , then the function maps the set one-to-one and onto the rectangle . Figure shows the mapping , its branch cut , the set , and its image .   The branch of the logarithm    We can easily compute the derivative of any branch of the multivalued logarithm. For a particular branch for , and (note the strict inequality for ), we start with in Equations and differentiate both sides to get .  Solving for gives   The Riemann surface for the multivalued function is similar to the one for the square root function. However, it requires infinitely many copies of the plane cut along the negative axis, which we label for . We stack these cut planes directly on each other so that the corresponding points have the same position, and join the sheet to as follows: For each integer , the edge of the sheet in the upper half-plane is joined to the edge of the sheet in the lower half-plane. The Riemann surface for the domain of looks like a spiral staircase that extends upward on the sheets and downward on the sheets , as shown in Figure . We use polar coordinates for on each sheet. Thus, for we have .  Again, for , the correct branch of on each sheet is .

  "body": " Complex Exponents  In Section we indicated that it is possible to make sense out of expressions such as or without appealing to a number system beyond the framework of complex numbers. We now show how this is done by taking note of some rudimentary properties of the complex exponential and logarithm, and then using our imagination.  We begin by generalizing Identity . Equations and show that can be expressed as the set . We can easily show (left as an exercise) that, for , , where is any branch of the function . But this means that, for any , the identity holds true. Because denotes the set , we see that , for .  Next, note that Identity gives , where is any natural number, so that , for . With these preliminaries out of the way, we can now come up with a definition of a complex number raised to a complex power.   Complex exponent   Let be a complex number. We define as .    The right side of Equation is a set. This definition makes sense because, if both and are real numbers with , Equation gives the familiar (real) definition for , as the following example illustrates.    Use Equation to evaluate .    Calculating gives .  Thus is the set . The distinct values occur when . Plugging these values into Equation gives and . In other words, .    The expression is different from , as the former represents the set and the latter gives only one value, .  Because is multivalued, the function will, in general, be multivalued. If we want to focus on a single value for , we can do so via the function defined for by , which is called the principal branch of the multivalued function . Note that the principal branch of is obtained from Equation by replacing with the principal branch of the logarithm.    Find the principal values of and .   From Example  .  Identity yields the principal values of and : .   Note that the result of raising a complex number to a complex power may be a real number in a nontrivial way.    We now consider the possibilities that arise when we apply Equation .   Case(i) : Suppose that , where is an integer. Then, if , . Recalling that the complex exponential function has period , we have , which is the single-valued th power of that we discussed in Section .   Case(ii): If , where is an integer, and , then . Hence, Equation becomes .  When we again use the periodicity of the complex exponential function, Equation gives distance values corresponding to .  Therefore, as Example illustrated, the fractional power is the multivalued th root function.   Case(iii): If and are positive integers that have no common factors and , then Equation becomes . Again, there are distance values that correspond with .   Case(iv): If is not a rational number, then there are infinitely many values for , provided .    The values of are , where is an integer. The principal value of is      Figure shows the terms for this multivalued expression corresponding to .  They exhibit a spiral pattern that is often present in complex powers.   Some of the values of    Some of the rules for exponents carry over from the real case. In the exercises we ask you to show that if and are complex numbers and , then , where is an integer.  The following example shows that Identity does not hold if is replaced with an arbitrary complex value.     Since these sets of solutions are not equal, Identity does not always hold.    We can compute the derivative of the principal branch of , which is the function . By the chain rule, .  If we restrict to the principal branch, , then Equation can be written in the familiar form that you learned in calculus. That is, for and not a negative real number,   We can use Identity to define the exponential function with base , where is a complex number:   If we specify a branch of the logarithm, then will be single-valued and we can use the rules of differentiation to show that the resulting branch of is an analytic function. The derivative of is then given by the familiar rule , where is any branch of the logarithm whose branch cut does not include the point .

  "body": " Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions  Based on the success we had in using power series to define the complex exponential, we have reason to believe that this approach will also be fruitful for other elementary functions. The power series expansions for the real-valued sine and cosine functions are . so it is natural to make the following definitions.   $\\mathbf{\\sin } z and \\cos z$      With these definitions in place, we can now easily create the other complex trigonometric functions, provided the denominators in the following expressions are not zero.   Other Trigonometric functions      The series for the complex sine and cosine agree with the real sine and cosine when is real, so the remaining complex trigonometric functions likewise agree with their real counterparts. What additional properties are common? For starters, we have     and are entire functions, with and .     The ratio test shows that the radius of convergence for both functions is infinity, so they are entire by Theorem , part (i). Part (iii) of that theorem gives .  We leave the proof that as an exercise.   We now list several additional properties, providing proofs for some and leaving others as exercises.   For all complex numbers , . The verification that and comes from substituting for in Definition . We leave verification of the identity as an exercise (with hints).    For all complex numbers for which the expressions are defined, . The proof that uses the identity : . We leave the proofs of the other derivative formulas as exercises.     To establish additional properties, expressing and in the Cartesian form will be useful. (Additionally, the applications in Chapters 10 and 11 will use these formulas.) We begin by observing that the argument given to prove part (iii) in Theorem easily generalizes to the complex case with the aid of Definition . That is, , for all , whether is real or complex. Hence .  Subtracting Equation from Equation and solving for gives , where and , respectively, are the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions that you studied in calculus.  Similarly, .  Equipped with Identities , we can now establish many other properties of the trigonometric functions. We begin with some periodic results.   For all complex numbers , . Clearly, . By Identity this expression is . Again, the proofs for the other periodic results are left as exercises.    If and are any complex numbers, then . We demonstrate that by making use of Identities : . Adding these expressions gives , which is what we wanted. A solution to the equation is called a zero of the given function . As we now show, the zeros of the sine and cosine function are exactly where you might expect them to be.    We have iff , where is any integer, and iff , where is any integer. We show the result for and leave the result for as an exercise. When we use Identity , iff . Equating the real and imaginary parts of this equation gives . The real-valued function is never zero, so the equation implies that , from which we obtain for any integer . Using the values for in the equation yields , which implies that , so the only zeros for are the values for any integer .     What does the mapping look like? We can get a graph of the mapping by using parametric methods. Let's consider the vertical line segments in the plane obtained by successfully setting for , and for each value and letting vary continuously, . In the exercises we ask you to show that the images of these vertical segments are hyperbolas in the plane, as Figure illustrates. In , we give a more detailed analysis of the mapping .   Vertical segments mapped onto hyperbolas by     Figure suggests one big difference between the real and complex sine functions. The real sine has the property that for all real . In Figure , however, the modulus of the complex sine appears to be unbounded, which is indeed the case. Using Identity gives .  The identities and then yield .  A similar derivation produces .  If we set in Identity and let , we get   As advertised, we have shown that is not a bounded function; it is also evident from Identity that is unbounded.  The periodic character of the trigonometric functions makes apparent that any point in their ranges is actually the image of infinitely many points.    Find the values of for which .    Starting with Identity , we write .  If we equate real and imaginary parts, then we get .  The equation implies either that , where is an integer, or that . Using in the equation leads to the impossible situation . Therefore , where is an integer. Since for all values of , the term in the equation must also be positive. For this reason we eliminate the odd values of and get , where is an integer.  Finally, we solve the equation and use the fact that is an even function to conclude that . Therefore the solutions to the equation are , where is an integer.    The hyperbolic functions also have practical use in putting the tangent function into the Cartesian form . Using Definition , and Equations and , we have   If we multiply each term on the right by the conjugate of the denominator, the simplified result is .  We leave it as an exercise to show that the identities and can be used in simplifying Equation to get .  As with , we obtain a graph of the mapping parametrically. Consider the vertical line segments in the plane obtained by successively setting for and for each value letting vary continuously, . In the exercises we ask you to show that the images of these vertical segments are circular arcs in the plane, as Figure shows. In Section we give a more detailed investigation of the mapping .   Vertical segments mapped onto circular arcs by    How should we define the complex hyperbolic functions? We begin with   $\\mathbf{\\cosh} z$ and $\\sinh z$      With these definitions in place, we can now easily create the other complex hyperbolic trigonometric functions, provided the denominators in the following expressions are not zero.   Complex hyperbolic functions      As the series for the complex hyperbolic sine and cosine agree with the real hyperbolic sine and cosine when is real, the remaining complex hyperbolic trigonometric functions likewise agree with their real counterparts. Many other properties are also shared. We state several results without proof, as they follow from the definitions we gave using standard operations, such as the quotient rule for derivatives. We ask you to establish some of these identities in the exercises.  The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions follow the same rules as in calculus: .  The hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine can be expressed as .  The complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are all defined in terms of the exponential function, so we can easily show them to be related by .  Some of the important identities involving the hyperbolic functions are .  We conclude this section with an example from electronics. In electric circuits, the voltage drop, , across a resistance obeys Ohm's law, , where is the current flowing through the resistor. Additionally, the current and voltage drop across an inductor, , obey the equation   The current and voltage across a capacitor, , are related by   The voltages , and and the impressed voltage illustrated in Figure satisfy the equation .   An circuit    Suppose that the current in the circuit is given by   Using this in the equations for and gives .  We then set in the equation for to obtain .  We rewrite the equation as a complex current,  with the understanding that the actual physical current is the imaginary part of . Similarly, we rewrite Equations as .

In this section we look at their inverses. When we solve equations such as for , we obtain formulas that involve the logarithm. Because trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are all periodic, they are many-to-one; hence their inverses are necessarily multivalued. The formulas for the inverse trigonometric functions are .  We can find the derivatives of any branch of these functions by using the chain rule: .  We derive Equations and and leave the others as exercises. If we take a particular branch of the multivalued function, , we have , which we can also write as .  Multiplying both sides of this equation by gives , which is a quadratic equation in terms of . Using the quadratic equation to solve for , we obtain , where the square root is a multivalued function. Taking the logarithm of both sides of this last equation leads to the desired result: . where the multivalued logarithm is used. To construct a specific branch of , we must first select a branch of the square root and then select a branch of the logarithm.  We get the derivative of by starting with the equation and differentiating both sides, using the chain rule: .

Theorem provides our main result, which shows how to transform the latter type of integral into the kind we investigated in Section .  We use concepts first introduced in Section . Recall that to represent a curve in the plane we use the parametric notation , where and are continuous functions. We now place a few more restrictions on the type of curve to be described. The following discussion leads to the concept of a contour, which is a type of curve that is adequate for the study of integration.  Recall that is simple if it does not cross itself, which means that whenever , except possibly when and . A curve with the property is a closed curve. If is the only point of intersection, then we say that is a simple closed curve. As the parameter increases from the value to the value , the point starts at the initial point  , moves along the curve , and ends up at the terminal point  . If is simple, then moves continuously from to as increases and the curve is given an orientation , which we indicate by drawing arrows along the curve. Figure illustrates how the terms simple and closed describe a curve.   The terms simple and closed used to describe curves    The complex-valued function is said to be differentiable on if both and are differentiable for . Here we require the one-sided derivatives The derivatives on the right, , and on the left, , are defined by the limits . of and to exist at the endpoints of the interval. As in Section , the derivative is   The curve defined by Equation is said to be a smooth curve if the function is continuous and nonzero on the interval. If is a smooth curve, then has a nonzero tangent vector at each point , which is given by the vector . If , then the tangent vector is vertical. If , then the slope of the tangent line to at the point is given by . Hence for a smooth curve the angle of inclination of its tangent vector is defined for all values of and is continuous. Thus a smooth curve has no corners or cusps. Figure illustrates this concept.   The term smooth used to describe curves    If is a smooth curve, then , the differential of arc length, is given by   The function is continuous because and are continuous functions, so the length of the curve is .  Now, consider to be a curve with parametrization   The opposite curve traces out the same set of points in the plane, but in the reverse order, and has the parametrization . Since , is merely traversed in the opposite sense, as Figure illustrates.   The curve and its opposite curve    A curve that is constructed by joining finitely many smooth curves end to end is called a contour. Let denote smooth curves such that the terminal point of the curve coincides with the initial point of , for . We express the contour by the equation . A synonym for contour is path .    Find a parametrization of the polygonal path from to shown in Figure .    We express as three smooth curves, or . If we set and , we can use Equation to get a formula for the straight-line segment joining two points: .  When simplified, this formula becomes .  Similarly, the segments and are given by .     The polygonal path { { }} from to     Partition points and function evaluation points for a Riemann sum along the contour from to    We are now ready to define the integral of a complex function along a contour in the plane with initial point and terminal point . Our approach is to mimic what is done in calculus. We create a partition of points that proceed along from to and form the differences , for . Between each pair of partition points and we select a point on , as shown in Figure , and evaluate the function . We use these values to make a Riemann sum for the partition: .  Assume now that there exists a unique complex number that is the limit of every sequence of Riemann sums given in Equation , where the maximum of tends toward 0 for the sequence of partitions. That number is the value of the integral of the function along .   Complex integral   Let be a contour. Then , provided the limit exists in the sense previously discussed.    In Definition the value of the integral depends on the contour. In Section the Cauchy-Goursat theorem will establish the remarkable fact that, if is analytic, then is independent of the contour.    Use a Riemann sum to approximate the integral  , where is the line segment joining the point to .    Set in Equation and form the partition for . For this situation, we have a uniform increment . For convenience we select , for . Figure shows the points and .   Partition and evaluation points for the Riemann sum    One possible Riemann sum, then, is . By rounding the terms in this Riemann sum to two decimal digits, we obtain an approximation for the integral: .  This result compares favorably with the precise value of the integral, which you will soon see equals     In general, obtaining an exact value for an integral given by Definition could be a daunting task. Fortunately, there is a beautiful theory that allows for an easy computation of many contour integrals. Suppose that we have a parametrization of the contour given by the function for . That is, is the range of the function over the interval , as Figure shows.   A parametrization of the contour by , for    It follows that . where and are the points contained in the interval with the property that and , as is also shown in Figure . If for all we multiply the th term in the last sum by , then we get .  The quotient inside the last summation looks suspiciously like a derivative, and the entire quantity looks like a Riemann sum. Assuming no difficulties, this last expression should equal , as defined in Section . Of course, if we're to have any hope of this happening, we would have to get the same limit regardless of how we parametrize the contour . As Theorem states, this is indeed the case.    Suppose that is a continuous complex-valued function defined on a set containing the contour . Let be any parametrization of for . Then     We omit the proof of Theorem because it involves ideas ( e.g. , the theory of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral) that are beyond the scope of this book. A more rigorous development of the contour integral based on Riemann sums is presented in advanced texts such as L. V. Ahlfors, Complex Analysis, 3rd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979).  Two important facets of Theorem are worth mentioning. First, Theorem makes the problem of evaluating complex-valued functions along contours easy, as it reduces the task to the evaluation of complex-valued functions over real intervals a procedure that you studied in Section . Second, according to Theorem 6.1, this transformation yields the same answer regardless of the parametrization we choose for .    Give an exact calculation of the integral in Example .    We must compute  , where is the line segment joining to . According to Equation , we can parametrize by , for . As , Theorem guarantees that .  Each integral in the last expression can be done using integration by parts. (There is a simpler way see Remark .) We leave as an exercise to show that the final answer simplifies to , as we claimed in Example .      Evaluate .    Recall that is the upper semicircle with radius 1 centered at oriented in a positive direction ( i.e. , counterclockwise). The function , for is a parametrization for . We apply Theorem with . (Note: , and .) Hence     To help convince yourself that the value of the integral is independent of the parametrization chosen for the given contour, try working through Example 6.8 with , for .  A convenient bookkeeping device can help you remember how to apply Theorem . Because , you can symbolically equate with and with . These identities should be easy to remember because is supposed to be a point on the contour parametrized by , and , according to the Leibniz notation for the derivative.  If , then by the preceding paragraph we have . where and are the differentials for and , respectively ( i.e. , is equated with , etc.). The expression is often called the complex differential of . Just as and are intuitively considered to be small segments along the and axes in real variables, we can think of as representing a tiny piece of the contour . Moreover, if we write , we can put Equation into the form . so we can think of as representing the length of .  Suppose that and that is a parametrization for the contour . Then , where Equation replaced with with , and so on.  If we use the differentials given in Equation , then we can write Equation in terms of line integrals of the real-valued functions and , giving . which is easy to remember if we recall that, symbolically,   We emphasize that Equation is merely a notational device for applying Theorem . You should carefully apply Theorem 6.1, as illustrated in Examples and , before using any shortcuts suggested by Equation .    Show that , where is the line segment from to and is the portion of the parabola joining to , as indicated in Figure .   Two contours and joining to    The line segment joining to is given by the slope intercept formula , which can be written as . If we choose the parametrization and , we can write segment as .  Along we have . Applying Theorem gives . We now multiply out the integrand and put it into its real and imaginary parts: . Similarly, we can parametrize the portion of the parabola joining to by and so that .  Along we have . Theorem now gives .    In Example , the value of the two integrals is the same. This outcome doesn't hold in general, as Example shows.    Show that . where is the semicircular path from to 1 and is the polygonal path from to 1, respectively, shown in Figure .   Two contours and joining to 1      We parametrize the semicircle as . Applying Theorem , we have , so .  We parametrize in three parts, one for each line segment: . where in each case. We get our answer by adding the three integrals along the three segments: . Separating the right side of this equation into its real and imaginary parts gives . Note that the value of the contour integral along isn't the same as the value of the contour integral along , although both integrals have the same initial and terminal points.    Contour integrals have properties that are similar to those of integrals of a complex function of a real variable, which you studied in Section . If is given by Equation , then the integral for the opposite contour is   Using the change of variable in this last equation and the property that , we obtain .  If two functions and can be integrated over the same path of integration , then their sum can be integrated over , and we have the familiar result   Constant multiples also behave as we would expect:   If two contours and are placed end to end so that the terminal point of coincides with the initial point of , then the contour is a continuation of , and .  If the contour has two parametrizations . and there exists a differentiable function such that . then we say that is a reparametrization of the contour . If is continuous on , then we have .  Equation shows that the value of a contour integral is invariant under a change in the parametric representation of its contour if the reparametrization satisfies Equations .  We now give two important inequalities relating to complex integrals.   Absolute value inequality   If is a continuous function of the real parameter , then .     If , then Equation is obviously true. If the integral is not zero, we write its value in polar form, say , so that , and . Taking the real part of both sides of this last equation gives . where the last equality is justified because an integral is a limit of a sum, and its real part is the same as the limit of the sum of its real parts.  Now, using Equation , we obtain .  Recall that, if and are real functions, with , for all , then . Applying this fact to the left and right sides of Equation \\big(with and \\big) yields   Since , this last inequality establishes our result.    ML inequality   If is continuous on the contour , then , where is the length of the contour and is an upper bound for the modulus on ; that is, for all .     Using Inequality with Theorem gives .   Equations , , and Inequality imply that      Use Inequality to show that . where is the straight-line segment from 2 to .   Here , and the terms and represent the distance from the point to the points and , respectively. Referring to Figure and using a geometric argument, we get     The distances and for on    Thus we have . Because , the length of , equals 1, and Inequality implies that      Exercises   Give a parametrization of each contour.   , as indicated in Figure .   ; .    , as indicated in Figure .

  "title": "The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem",
  "body": " The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem  The Cauchy-Goursat theorem states that within certain domains the integral of an analytic function over a simple closed contour is zero. An extension of this theorem allows us to replace integrals over certain complicated contours with integrals over contours that are easy to evaluate. We demonstrate how to use the technique of partial fractions with the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to evaluate certain integrals. In Section we show that the Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that an analytic function has an antiderivative. To begin, we need to introduce some new concepts.  Recall from Section that each simple closed contour divides the plane into two domains. One domain is bounded and is called the interior of ; the other domain is unbounded and is called the exterior of . Figure illustrates this concept, which is known as the Jordan curve theorem.   The interior and exterior of simple closed contours    Recall also that a domain is a connected open set. In particular, if and are any pair of points in , then they can be joined by a curve that lies entirely in . A domain is said to be a simply connected domain if the interior of any simple closed contour contained in is contained in . In other words, there are no holes in a simply connected domain. A domain that is not simply connected is called a multiply connected domain. Figure illustrates uses of the terms simply connected and multiply connected .   Simply connected and multiply connected domains    Let the simple closed contour have the parametrization for . Recall that if is parametrized so that the interior of is kept on the left as moves around , then we say that is oriented positively (counterclockwise); otherwise, is oriented negatively (clockwise) . If is positively oriented, then is negatively oriented. Figure illustrates the concept of positive and negative orientation.   Positively and negatively oriented simple closed contours    Green's theorem is an important result from the calculus of real variables. It tells you how to evaluate the line integral of real-valued functions.   Green's theorem   Let be a simple closed contour with positive orientation and let be the domain that forms the interior of . If and are continuous and have continuous partial derivatives , and at all points on and then .     (We give a proof for a standard region , which is a region that is bounded by a contour tha can be expressed in the two forms and .) If is a standard region, then there exist functions , and , for , whose graphs form the lower and upper portions of , respectively, as indicated in Figure . As is positively oriented, these functions can be used to express as the sum of two contours and , where .  We now use the functions and to express the double integral of over as an iterated integral, first with respect to and second with respect to : . Computing the first iterated integral on the right side gives . In the second integral on the right side of this equation we can use the change of variable to obtain    Integration over a standard region, where    Interpreting the two integrals on the right side of this equation as contour integrals along and , respectively, gives .  To complete the proof, we rely on the fact that for a standard region there exist functions and for whose graphs form the left and right portions of , respectively, as indicated in Figure .   Integration over a standard region, where    Because has positive orientation, it can be expressed as the sum of two contours and , where .  Using the functions and , we express the double integral of over as an iterated integral: . A derivation similar to that which led to Equation shows that .  Adding Equations and gives Equation .   We are now ready to state the main result of this section.   Cauchy-Goursat theorem   Let be analytic in a simply connected domain . If is a simple closed contour that lies in , then .    We give two proofs. The first, by Augustin Cauchy, is more intuitive but requires the additional hypothesis that is continuous.   (Cauchy 's proof of Theorem .) If we suppose that is continuous, then with oriented positively we use Equation to write .  If we use Green's theorem on the real part of the right side of Equation (with and , we obtain , where is the region that is the interior of . If we use Green's theorem on the imaginary part, we get .  If we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations and in Equations and , Equation becomes , which completes the proof.   In 1883, Edward Goursat (1858-1936) produced a proof that does not require the continuity of .   We first establish the result for a triangular contour with positive orientation. We then construct four positively oriented contours , , , and that are the triangles obtained by joining the midpoints of the sides of , as Figure shows.   The triangular contours and , , , and    Each contour is positively oriented, so if we sum the integrals along the four triangular contours, the integrals along the segments interior to cancel out in pairs, giving .  Let be selected from , , , and so that the following holds:   Proceeding inductively, we carry out a similar subdivision process to obtain a sequence of triangular contours , where the interior of lies in the interior of and the following inequality holds:   We let denote the closed region that consists of and its interior. The length of the sides of go to zero as , so there exists a unique point that belongs to all the closed triangular regions . Since is simply connected, , so is analytic at the point . Thus, there exists a function such that .  Using Equation and integrating along , we get .  Since , we know that given , we can find such that , where is the length of the original contour . We can now choose an integer so that lies in the neighborhood , as shown in Figure 6.21.   The contour that lies in the neighborhood    Since the distance between any point on a triangle and a point interior to the triangle is less than half the perimeter of the triangle, it follows that , where is the length of the triangle . From the preceding construction process, it follows that .  We can use Equations , , and and Theorem to conclude .  Because was arbitrary, it follows that our theorem holds for the triangular contour . If is a polygonal contour, then we can add interior edges until the interior is subdivided into a finite number of triangles. The integral around each triangle is zero, and the sum of all these integrals equals the integral around the polygonal contour . Therefore our theorem also holds for polygonal contours. The proof for an arbitrary simple closed contour is established by approximating the contour sufficiently close with a polygonal contour. We omit the details of this last step.     Recall that , , and (where is a positive integer) are all entire functions. The Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that, for any simple closed contour, .      Let be an integer. If is a simple closed contour such that the origin does not lie interior to , then there is a simply connected domain that contains in which is analytic, as is indicated in Figure . The Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that .   A simple connected domain containing the simple closed contour that does not contain the origin      We want to be able to replace integrals over certain complicated contours with integrals that are easy to evaluate. If is a simple closed contour that can be continuously deformed into another simple closed contour without passing through a point where is not analytic, then the value of the contour integral of over is the same as the value of the integral of over . To be precise, we state the following result.   Deformation of contour   Let and be two simple closed positively oriented contours such that lies interior to . If is analytic in a domain that contains both and and the region between them, as shown in Figure , then      The domain that contains the simple closed contours and and the region between them     Assume that both and have positive (counterclockwise) orientation. We construct two disjoint contours or cuts , and , that join to . The contour is cut into two contours and , and the contour is cut into and . We now form two new contours: , which are shown in Figure . The function will be analytic on a simply connected domain that contains , and will be analytic on the simply connected domain that contains , as illustrated in Figure .   The cuts and and the contours and used to prove the deformation of contour theorem    We apply the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to the contours and , giving .  Adding contours gives .  We use Identities and of Section and Equations and in this proof to conclude that , which establishes the theorem.   We now state as a corollary an important result that is implied by the deformation of contour theorem. This result occurs several times in the theory to be developed and is an important tool for computations. You may want to compare the proof of Corollary with your solution to Exercise from Section .    Let denote a fixed complex value. If is a simple closed contour with positive orientation such that lies interior to , then , where is any integer except .     Since lies interior to , we can choose so that the circle with center and radius lies interior to . Hence is analytic in a domain that contains both and and the region between them, as shown in Figure .   The domain that contains both and    We let have the parametrization .  The deformation of contour theorem implies that the integral of over has the same value as the integral of over , so and .   The deformation of contour theorem is an extension of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem to a doubly connected domain in the following sense. We let be a domain that contains and and the region between them, as shown in Figure . Then the contour is a parametrization of the boundary of the region that lies between and so that the points of lie to the left of as a point moves around . Hence is a positive orientation of the boundary of , and Theorem implies that .  We can extend Theorem to multiply connected domains with more than one hole. The proof, which we leave for you, involves the introduction of several cuts and is similar to the proof of Theorem .   Extended Cauchy-Goursat theorem   Let be simple closed positively oriented contours with the properties that lies interior to for , and the interior of has no points in common with the interior of if . Let be analytic on a domain that contains all the contours and the region between and , as shown in Figure . Then      The multiply connected domain and the contours and in the statement of the extended Cauchy-Goursat theorem      Show that .    Recall that is the circle with positive orientation. Using partial fraction decomposition gives  .  The points lie interior to , so Corollary implies that . Substituting these values into Equation yields       Show that .    Recall that is the circle having positive orientation. Using partial fractions again, we have . In this case, lies interior to but does not, as shown in Figure .   The circle and the points    By Corollary , the second integral on the right side of this equation has the value . The first integral equals zero by the Cauchy-Goursat theorem because the function is analytic on a simply connected domain that contains . Thus       Show that , where is the figure eight contour shown in Figure (a).   The contour      Again, we use partial fractions to express the integral: .  Using the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, Property , and Corollary (with ), we compute the value of the first integral on the right side of Equation : .  Similarly, we find that .  If we substitute the results of the last two equations into Equation we get      Exercises   Determine the domain of analyticity for the following functions and evaluate .   .  Analytic everywhere except at . We break the integral up using partial fractions: . Both lie inside , so Corollary 6.1 gives .    .   .

  "body": " The Fundamental Theorems of Integration  Let be analytic in the simply connected domain . The theorems in this section show that an antiderivative can be constructed by contour integration. A consequence will be the fact that in a simply connected domain, the integral of an analytic function along any contour joining to is the same, and its value is given by . As a result, we can use the antiderivative formulas from calculus to compute the value of definite integrals.   Indefinite integrals, or antiderivatives   Let be analytic in the simply connected domain . If is a fixed value in , and if is any contour in with initial point and terminal point , then the function is well-defined and analytic in , with its derivative given by .     We first establish that the integral is independent of the path of integration. This will show that the function is well-def i.e. , which in turn will justify the notation .  We let and be two contours in , both with initial point and terminal point , as shown in Figure .   The contours and joining to    Then is a simple closed contour, and the Cauchy-Goursat theorem implies that .  Therefore, the contour integral in Equation is independent of path. Here we have taken the liberty of drawing contours that intersect only at the endpoints. A slight modification of the proof shows that a finite number of other points of intersection are permitted.  We now show that . Let be held fixed, and let be chosen small enough so that the point also lies in the domain . Since is held fixed, , where is a constant, and Equation implies that .  Using the additive property of contours and the definition of given in Equation , we have . where the contour is the straight-line segment joining to , and and join to , and to , respectively, as shown in Figure .   The contours and and the line segment    Since is continuous at , for any there is a so that . If we require that and combine this last inequality with Equations and , and Theorem , we get .  Thus tends to 0 as , so .    It is important to stress that the line integral of an analytic function is independent of path. In Example we showed that , where and were different contours joining to . Because the integrand is an analytic function, Theorem lets us know ahead of time that the value of the two integrals is the same; hence one calculation would have sufficed. If you ever have to compute a line integral of an analytic function over a difficult contour, change the contour to something easier. You are guaranteed to get the same answer. Of course, you must be sure that the function you're dealing with is analytic in a simply connected domain containing your original and new contours.   If we set in Theorem , then we obtain the following familiar result for evaluating a definite integral of an analytic function.   Definite integrals   Let be analytic in a simply connected domain . If and are any two points in joined by a contour , then , where is any antiderivative of in .     If we choose to be the function defined by Formula , then Equation holds. If is any other antiderivative of in , then for all . Thus the function is analytic in , and , for all . Thus, by Theorem , this means , for all , where is some complex constant. Therefore , so , which establishes our theorem.    Theorem gives an important method for evaluating definite integrals when the integrand is an analytic function in a simply connected domain. In essence, it permits you to use all the rules of integration that you learned in calculus. When the conditions of Theorem are met, applying it is generally much easier than parametrizing a contour.    Show that , where is the principal branch of the square root function and is the line segment joining 4 to .    We showed in Chapter 3 that if , then , where the principal branch of the square root function is used in both the formulas for and .

  "body": " Integral Representations  We now present some major results in the theory of functions of a complex variable. The first one is known as Cauchy 's integral formula. It shows that the value of an analytic function can be represented by a certain contour integral. The derivative, , has a similar representation. In Chapter , we use these results to prove Taylor's theorem and also establish the power series representation for analytic functions. The Cauchy integral formulas are a convenient tool for evaluating certain contour integrals.   Cauchy 's integral formula   Let be analytic in the simply connected domain and let be a simple closed positively oriented contour that lies in . If is a point that lies interior to , then .     Because is continuous at , if is given there is a such that the positively oriented circle lies interior to (as Figure shows) and such that .   The contours and in the proof of Cauchy 's integral formula    Since is a fixed value, we can use the result of Corollary to conclude that .  By the deformation of contour theorem ( Theorem ), .  Using Inequality and Equations and above, together with the ML inequality ( Theorem ), we obtain the estimate: .  This proves the theorem because can be made arbitrarily small.     Show that .    Recall that is the circle centered at 0 with radius 2 and having positive orientation. We have and . The point lies interior to the circle, so Cauchy 's integral formula implies that . Multiplication by establishes the desired result.      Show that .    Here we have . We manipulate the integral and use Cauchy 's integral formula to obtain .      Show that .    We see that . The only zero of this expression that lies in the interior of is . We set and use Theorem to conclude that .    We now state a general result that shows how to accomplish differentiation under the integral sign. The proof is in some advanced texts. See, for instance, Rolf Nevanlinna and V. Paatero, Introduction to Complex Analysis (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1969), Section 9.7.   Leibniz's rule   Let be an open set and let be an interval of real numbers. Let and its partial derivative with respect to be continuous functions for all in and all in . Then is analytic for in , and .    We now generalize Theorem to give an integral representation for the th derivative, . We use Leibniz's rule in the proof and note that this method of proof serves as a mnemonic device for remembering Theorem .   Cauchy 's integral formulas for derivatives   Let be analytic in the simply connected domain and let be a simple closed positively oriented contour that lies in . If is a point that lies interior to C, then for any integer , .     Because , the case for reduces to Theorem . We now establish the theorem for the case . We start by using the parametrization . We use Theorem and write .  The integrand on the right side of Equation is a function of the two variables and , where . Moreover, and are continuous on the interior of , which is an open set. Applying Leibniz's rule to Equations gives , and the proof for the case is complete. We can apply the same argument to the analytic function and show that its derivative is also represented by Equation for . The principle of mathematical induction establishes the theorem for all integers .     Let denote a fixed complex value. Show that, if is a simple closed positively oriented contour such that lies interior to , then for any integer , .    We let . Then for . Theorem implies that the value of the first integral in Equations is . and Theorem further implies that .    This result is the same as that proven earlier in Corollary . Obviously, though, the technique of using Theorems and is easier.    Show that .    If we let , then a straightforward calculation shows that . Using Cauchy 's integral formulas with , we conclude that     We now state two important corollaries of Theorem .    If is analytic in the domain , then, for integers , all derivatives exist for (and therefore are analytic in ).     For each point in , there exists a closed disk that is contained in . We use the circle in Theorem to show that exists for all integers .    This result is interesting, as it illustrates a big difference between real and complex functions. A real function can have the property that exists everywhere in a domain , but exists nowhere. Corollary states that if a complex function has the property that exists everywhere in a domain , then, remarkably, all derivatives of exist in .

  "title": "The Theorems of Morera and Liouville",
  "body": " The Theorems of Morera and Liouville  In this section we investigate some of the qualitative properties of analytic and harmonic functions. Our first result shows that the existence of an antiderivative for a continuous function is equivalent to the statement that the integral of is independent of the path of integration. This result is stated in a form that will serve as a converse of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem.   Morera's theorem   Let be a continuous function in a simply connected domain . If for every closed contour in , then is analytic in .     We select a point in and define by , where the notation indicates the integral is taken on any contour that begins at and ends at . The function is well defined because, if and are two contours in both with initial point and terminal point , then is a closed contour in , and by hypothesis,   Since is continuous, we know that for any there exists such that whenever . Now we can use the same steps as those in the proof of Theorem to show that . Hence is analytic on , and Corollary implies that and are also analytic. Therefore exists for all in , proving that is analytic in .   Cauchy 's integral formula shows how the value can be represented by a contour integral. If we choose the contour of integration to be a circle with center , then we can show that the value is the integral average of the values of at points on the circle , a fact that the following theorem elucidates.   Gauss's mean value theorem   If is analytic in a simply connected domain that contains the circle , then      We parametrize the circle by , and use this parametrization along with Cauchy 's integral formula to obtain .   We now prove an important result concerning the modulus of an analytic function.   Maximum modulus principle   Let be analytic and nonconstant in the domain . Then does not attain a maximum value at any point in .     (By contraposition): Assume the contrary and suppose that there exists a point in such that holds for all in . If is any circle contained in , Theorems and imply that , for . We now treat as a real-valued function of the real variable and use Inequality to get , for . Combining Inequalities and gives , which we rewrite as .  A theorem from calculus states that if the integral of a nonnegative continuous function taken over an interval is zero, then that function must be identically zero. Since Inequality implies that the integrand in Equation is a nonnegative real-valued function, we conclude that it is identically zero; that is, .  If the modulus of an analytic function is constant in a closed disk, then the function is constant in that closed disk by Theorem . Therefore we conclude from Identity that , where . Now we let denote an arbitrary point in be a contour in the original domain that joins to , and 2 denote the minimum distance from to the boundary of . We can find consecutive points along , with , such that the disks , for , are contained in and cover as illustrated in Figure .   The chain of disks  that cover    Each disk contains the center of the next disk , so it follows that lies in and, from Equation  also reaches its maximum value at . An identical argument to the one given above will show that .  We proceed inductively to get , from which it follows that . Therefore is constant in , which contradicts the assumption of our theorem. With this contraposition, the proof is complete.   We sometimes state the maximum modulus principle in the following form.   Maximum modulus principle   Let be analytic and nonconstant in the bounded domain . If is continuous on the closed region that consists of and all its boundary points , then assumes its maximum value, and does so only at point(s ) on the boundary .      Let . If we set our domain to be , then is continuous on the closed region . Prove that , and that this value is assumed by at a point on the boundary of .    From the triangle inequality and the fact that in , it follows that .  If we choose , where , then , so the vectors and lie on the same ray through the origin. This is the requirement for the Inequality to be an equality (see Exercise , Section ). Hence , and the result is established.     Cauchy 's inequalities   Let be analytic in the simply connected domain that contains the circle . If holds for all points , then .     Let have the parametrization .  We use Cauchy 's integral formula and write .  Combining this result with the ML inequality ( Theorem ), we obtain .    Theorem shows that a nonconstant entire function cannot be a bounded function.   Liouville's theorem   If is an entire function and is bounded for all values of in the complex plane, then is constant.     Suppose that holds for all values of , and let denote an arbitrary point. Using the circle and Cauchy 's Inequality with yields . Because can be arbitrarily large we must have . But was arbitrary, so for all . If the derivative of an analytic function is zero for all , then by Theorem the function must be constant. Therefore, is constant.     Show that the function is not a bounded function.    We established this characteristic with a somewhat tedious argument in Section . All we need do now is observe that is not constant, and hence it is not bounded.    We can use Liouville's theorem to establish an important theorem of elementary algebra.   The fundamental theorem of algebra   If is a polynomial of degree , then has at least one zero.     (By contraposition): We will show that if for all , then the degree of must be zero. Suppose that for all . This supposition implies that the function is an entire function. Our strategy for the rest of the proof is as follows: We will show that is bounded. Then Liouville's theorem will imply that is constant, and since , this conclusion will imply that the polynomial is constant, which will mean that its degree must be zero.  First we write and consider the equation .  For , as , so . Combining this result with Equation gives . In particular, we can find a value of such that .  If , we have . which is a continuous function of the two real variables and . A result from calculus regarding real functions says that a continuous function on a closed and bounded set is bounded. Hence is a bounded function on the closed disk . Thus there exists a positive real number such that . Combining this with Inequality gives , where . By Liouville's theorem, is constant, so that the degree of is zero. This observation completes the argument.     Let be a polynomial of degree . Then can be expressed as the product of linear factors. That is, where are the zeros of , counted according to multiplicity, and is a constant.     Exercises   Factor each polynomial as a product of linear factors.   .   .    .   .   .    . \\hint{Show that .}    Let , where the region is the disk . Show that .    Show that is not a bounded function.   We know that the complex cosine is an entire function that is not a constant. By Liouville's Theorem, it is not bounded.    Let . Evaluate the following, where represents the rectangular region defined by the set .   .   .   .   .    Let be analytic in the disk and suppose that for .  Find a bound for .   . (Explain.)

Establish the following minimum modulus principle .  Let be analytic and nonconstant in the domain , and continuous on the closed region that consists of and all its boundary points . Show that, if throughout , then assumes its minimum value, but does so only at point(s) on the boundary .  If for all in , where , then the function is analytic in . Apply the maximum modulus Theorem to the function to get your result.   Show that the requirement in part (a) is necessary by finding a function for which the requirement fails, and whose minimum modulus is attained at some place other than the boundary.    Let be harmonic for all . Show that , where . \\hint{Let , where is a harmonic conjugate of .}    Establish the following maximum principle for harmonic functions: Let be harmonic and nonconstant in the simply connected domain . Then does not have a maximum value at any point in .   Let , where is a harmonic conjugate of , so that is analytic in . The function is also analytic in , so that does not take on a maximum in by the maximum modulus Theorem. But for all (show why). This leads to the conclusion since is a real valued function, and the real valued function is an increasing function. Explain this last part in detail.    Let be an entire function with the property that for all . Show that is constant.    Let be nonconstant and analytic in the closed disk . Suppose that is constant for , i.e., that there is some number such that for all . Show that has a zero in , i.e. , that there exists some such that . \\hint{Use both the minimum modulus principle (see Exercise ) and maximum modulus principle.}   By contraposition) If does not have a zero, then is analytic in , so its maximum occurs on the boundary. Since is constant on the boundary, we conclude that both the maximum and the minimum of are the same, which means is constant.    Why is it important to study the fundamental theorem of algebra in a complex analysis course?    "

If the modulus of an analytic function is constant in a closed disk, then the function is constant in that closed disk by Theorem . Therefore we conclude from Identity that , where . Now we let denote an arbitrary point in be a contour in the original domain that joins to , and 2 denote the minimum distance from to the boundary of . We can find consecutive points along , with , such that the disks , for , are contained in and cover as illustrated in Figure .   The chain of disks  that cover    Each disk contains the center of the next disk , so it follows that lies in and, from Equation  also reaches its maximum value at . An identical argument to the one given above will show that .  We proceed inductively to get , from which it follows that . Therefore is constant in , which contradicts the assumption of our theorem. With this contraposition, the proof is complete.  "

  "body": " Uniform Convergence  Complex functions are the key to unlocking many of the mysteries encountered when power series are first introduced in a calculus course. We begin by discussing an important property associated with power series uniform convergence.  Recall that, for a function defined on a set , the sequence o f functions converges to at the point , provided . Thus, for the particular point , we know that for each , there exists a positive integer (depending on both and ) such that .  If is the th partial sum of the series , Statement becomes . For a given value of , the integer needed to satisfy Statement often depends on our choice of . This is not the case if the sequence converges uniformly. For a uniformly convergent sequence, it is possible to find an integer (depending only on ) that guarantees Statement no matter what value for we pick. In other words, if is large enough, the function is uniformly close to the function for all . Formally, we have the following definition.   Uniform convergence   The sequence converges uniformly to on the set if for every , there exists a positive integer (depending only on ) such that .  If is the th partial sum of the series , we say that the series converges uniformly to on the set .      The sequence converges uniformly to the function on the entire complex plane because for any , Statement is satisfied for all for , where is any integer greater than . We leave the details of showing this result as an exercise.    A good example of a sequence of functions that does not converge uniformly is the sequence of partial sums forming the geometric series. Recall that the geometric series has converging to for . Because the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers, we can show that Statement is not satisfied by demonstrating that it does not hold when we restrict our attention to the real numbers. In that context, becomes the open interval , and the inequality becomes , which for real variables is equivalent to the inequality . If Statement were to be satisfied, then given would be within an -bandwidth of  for all  in the interval provided were large enough. Figure illustrates that there is an such that, no matter how large is, we can find with the property that lies outside this bandwidth. In other words, Figure illustrates the negation of Statement , which in technical terms we state as: .   The geometric series does not converge uniformly on    In the exercises, we ask you to use Statement to show that the partial sums of the geometric series do not converge uniformly to for .  A useful procedure known as the Weierstrass -test can help determine whether an infinite series is uniformly convergent.   Weierstrass $M$-test   Suppose that the infinite series has the property that for each , for all . If converges, then converges uniformly on .     Let be the th partial sum of the series. Note that, If , then . Because the series converges, we can make the last expression as small as we want to by choosing a large enough . Thus, for , there is a positive integer such that if , , then . But this means that for all is a Cauchy sequence. According to Theorem , this sequence must converge to a number, which we might as well designate by . That is, . This observation gives us a function to which the series converges. However, we still must show that the convergence is uniform. Let be given. Again, since converges, there exists such that if , then . Thus, if and , then , which completes the argument.    Theorem gives an interesting application of the Weierstrass -test.    Suppose that the power series has radius of convergence . Then for each , , the series converges uniformly on the closed disk , where (by way of reminder) .     Given , with , choose such that . The proof of Theorem part ( ii ) reveals that converges absolutely for , from which it follows that converges. Moreover, for all , . The conclusion follows from the Weierstrass -test with .   An immediate consequence of Theorem is Corollary .    For each , the geometric series converges uniformly on the closed disk .    The following theorem gives important properties of uniformly convergent sequences.    Suppose that is a sequence of continuous functions defined on a set containing the contour . If converges uniformly to on the set , then   i   is continuous on , and    ii   .        Given , we must prove . Let be given. Since converges uniformly to on , there exists a positive integer such that for all whenever . And, as is continuous at , there exists such that if , then . Hence, if , we have , which completes part ( i ).  To prove part ( ii ), let be given and let be the length of the contour . Because converges uniformly to on , there exists a positive integer such that, if , then for all . Because is contained in , if , and we can use the ML inequality ( Theorem ) to get .     If the series converges uniformly to on the set and is a contour contained in , then       Show that , for all .    For , we choose and so that , thus ensuring that and that . By Corollary , the geometric series converges uniformly to on . If is any contour contained in , Corollary gives .  Clearly, the function is analytic in the simply connected domain , and Log is an antiderivative of for all , where Log is the principal branch of the logarithm. Likewise, is analytic in the simply connected domain , and is an antiderivative of for all . Hence, if is the straight-line segment joining to , we can apply Theorem to Equation to get , which becomes . The point was arbitrary, so the solution is complete.

  "body": " Taylor Series Representations  In Section we showed that functions defined by power series have derivatives of all orders ( Theorem ). In Section we demonstrated that analytic functions also have derivatives of all orders ( Corollary ). It seems natural, therefore, that there would be some connection between analytic functions and power series. As you might guess, the connection exists via the Taylor and Maclaurin series of analytic functions.   Taylor series   If is analytic at , then the series is called the Taylor series for centered at . When the center is , the series is called the Maclaurin series for  .    To investigate when these series converge we need the following lemma.    If , and are complex numbers with and , then , where is a positive integer.      . The result now follows from Corollary if in it we replace with . We leave verification of the details as an exercise.   We are now ready for the main result of this section.   Taylor's theorem   Suppose that is analytic in a domain and that is any disk contained in . Then the Taylor series for converges to for all in ; that is, .  Furthermore, for any , , the convergence is uniform on the closed subdisk .     If we can establish Equation , the uniform convergence on for will follow immediately from Theorem by equating the of that theorem with .  Let and let designate the distance between and so that . Note that because belongs to the open disk . We choose such that , and let be the positively oriented circle centered at with radius as shown in Figure .   The constructions for Taylor's theorem    With contained in , we can use the Cauchy integral formula to get   Replacing in the integrand by its equivalent expression in Lemma gives , where is a positive integer. We can put the last term in Equation in the form .  Recall also by the Cauchy integral formulas that .  Using these last two identities reduces Equation to   The summation on the right-hand side of this last expression is the first terms of the Taylor series. Verification of Equation relies on our ability to show that we can make the remainder term, , as small as we please by making sufficiently large. We will use the ML inequality ( Theorem ) to get a bound for . According to the constructions shown in Figure , we have .  By Property of Section , we also have .  If we set , Equations and allow us to conclude that, for all , .  The length of the circle is , so the ML inequality in conjunction with Equations and gives .  Because , the fraction is less than 1, so (and hence the right side of Equation ) goes to zero as goes to infinity. Thus, for any , we can find an integer such that for , and this fact completes the proof.   A singular point of a function is a point at which the function fails to be analytic. You will see in Section that singular points of a function can be classified according to how badly the function behaves at those points. Loosely speaking, a nonremovable singular point of a function has the property that it is impossible to redefine the value of the function at that point so as to make it analytic there. For example, the function has a nonremovable singularity at . We give a formal definition of this concept in Section , but with this language we can nuance Taylor's theorem a bit.    Suppose that is analytic in the domain that contains the point . Let be a nonremovable singular point of minimum distance to the point . If , then   i  the Taylor series converges to on all of , and    ii  if , the Taylor series does not converge to .        Taylor's theorem gives us part ( i ) immediately. To establish part ( ii ), we note that if , then whenever . If for some , with , the Taylor series converged to , then according to Theorem , the radius of convergence of the series would be at least equal to . We could then make differentiable at by redefining to equal the value of the series at , thus contradicting the fact that is a nonremovable singular point.     Show that is valid for .    In Example we established this identity with the use of Theorem . We now do so via Theorem . If , then a standard induction argument (which we leave as an exercise) will show that for . Thus , and Taylor's theorem gives , and since is analytic in , this series expansion is valid for all .      Show that, for , .    For , .  If we let take the role of in Equation , we get that for . But iff . Letting take the role of in Equation gives the second part of Equations .      Corollary clears up what often seems to be a mystery when series are first introduced in calculus. The calculus analog of Equations is .  For many students, it makes sense that the first series in Equations converges only on the interval because is undefined at the points . It seems unclear as to why this should also be the case for the series representing , since the real-valued function is defined everywhere. The explanation, of course, comes from the complex domain. The complex function is not defined everywhere. In fact, the singularities of are at the points , and the distance between them and the point equals 1. According to Corollary , therefore, Equations are valid only for , so Equations are valid only for .   Alas, there is a potential fly in this ointment: Corollary applies to Taylor series. To form the Taylor series of a function, we must compute its derivatives. We didn't get the series in Equations by computing derivatives, so how do we know that they are indeed the Taylor series centered at ? Perhaps the Taylor series would give completely different expressions from those given by Equations . Fortunately, Theorem removes this possibility.   Uniqueness of power series   Suppose that in some disk we have . Then , for .     By Theorem part ( ii ), , for .   Thus, any power series representation of is automatically the Taylor series.    Find the Maclaurin series of .    Computing derivatives for would be an onerous task. Fortunately, we can make use of the trigonometric identity . Recall that the series for (valid for all ) is . Using the identity for , we obtain .  By the uniqueness of power series, this last expression is the Maclaurin series for .    In the preceding argument we used some obvious results of power series representations that we haven't yet formally stated. The requisite results are part of Theorem .    Let and have the power series representations .  If and is any complex constant, then , where .  Identity is known as the Cauchy product of the series for and .     We leave the details of establishing Equations and for you to do as an exercise. To establish Equation , we note that the function is analytic in . Thus, for , .  By mathematical induction, we can generalize the preceding pattern to the th derivative, giving Leibniz's formula for the derivative of a product of functions: .  (We will ask you to show this result in an exercise.) By Theorem we know that , so Equation becomes .  Now, according to Taylor's theorem, . Substituting Equation into this equation gives Equation because of the uniqueness of power series.     Use the Cauchy product of series to show that     We let , for .

  "body": " Laurent Series Representations  Suppose that is not analytic in but is analytic in the punctured disk . For example, the function is not analytic when but is analytic for . Clearly, this function does not have a Maclaurin series representation. If we use the Maclaurin series for , however, and formally divide each term in that series by , we obtain the representation , which is valid for all such that .  This example raises the question as to whether it might be possible to generalize the Taylor series method to functions analytic in an annulus . Perhaps we can represent these functions with a series that involves negative powers of in some way as we did with . As you will see shortly, we can indeed. We begin by defining a series that allows for negative powers of .   Laurent Series   Let be a complex number for The doubly infinite series , called a Laurent series , is defined by , provided the series on the right-hand side of this equation converge.     Recall that is a simplified expression for the sum . At times it will be convenient to write as rather than using the expression given in Equation .    Annulus   Given , we define the annulus centered at with radii and by . The closed annulus centered at with radii and is denoted by      Figure illustrates an open annulus.   The open annulus (shaded)      Suppose that the Laurent series converges on the annulus . Then the series converges uniformly on any closed subannulus , where .     According to Equation , . By Theorem , the series must converge uniformly on the closed disk . By the Weierstrass -test, we can show that the series converges uniformly on (we leave the details as an exercise). Combining these two facts yields the required result.   The main result of this section specifies how functions analytic in an annulus can be expanded in a Laurent series. In it, we use symbols of the form , which we remind you designate the positively oriented circle with radius and center . That is, , oriented counterclockwise.   Laurent's theorem   Suppose that , and that is analytic in the annulus . If is any number such that , then for all has the Laurent series representation , where for , the coefficients and are given by .  Moreover, the convergence in Equation is uniform on any closed subannulus , where .     If we can establish Equation , the uniform convergence on will follow from Theorem . Let be an arbitrary point of . Choose small enough so that the circle is contained in . Since is analytic in , the Cauchy integral formula gives .  Let and , where we choose and so that lies in the region between and , and as shown in Figure , where the annulus is the shaded region.   The annulus and, in its interior, the circles , , and    Now let be the domain consisting of the annulus except for the point . The domain includes the contours , , and , as well as the region between and . In addition, since does not belong to , the function is analytic on , so by the extended Cauchy-Goursat theorem we obtain .  Subtracting the last integral from both sides of Equation and using the identity for in Equation give .  Now, if , then , so and we can use the geometric series ( Theorem ) to get .  Moreover, one can show by using the Weierstrass M -test that the preceding series converges uniformly for . We leave the details as an exercise. Likewise, using techniques similar to the ones just discussed, one can show that, for , , and that the convergence is uniform for . Again, we leave the details as an exercise.  Taking the series for as given by Equations and and substituting into the two integrals, respectively, of Equation yields .  Because the series in this equation converge uniformly on and , respectively, we can interchange the summations and the integrals, in accordance with Corollary to obtain .  If we move some terms around in the second series of this equation and reindex, we get .  We apply the extended Cauchy-Goursat theorem once more to conclude that the integrals taken over and in Equation give the same result if they are taken over the contour , where is any number such that . This yields .  Finally, writing the second series first in our last equation gives .  Because was arbitrary, this result establishes Equations and , completing the proof.   What happens to the Laurent series if is analytic in the disk ? Looking at Equation , we see that the coefficient for the positive power equals by using Cauchy 's integral formula for derivatives. Hence the series\\- in Equation involving the positive powers of is actually the Taylor series for . The Cauchy-Goursat theorem shows that the coefficients for the negative powers of equal zero. In this case, therefore, there are no negative powers involved, and the Laurent series reduces to the Taylor series.   Theorem delineates two important properties of the Laurent series.   Properties of Laurent Series   Suppose that is analytic in the annulus and has the Laurent series , for all .   i  If for all , then for all . (In other words, the Laurent series for in a given annulus is unique.)    ii  For all , the derivatives of may be obtained by termwise differentiation of its Laurent series.        We prove part ( i ) only because the proof for part ( ii ) involves no new ideas beyond those in the proof of Theorem . The series converges pointwise on , so Theorem guarantees that this series converges uniformly on , for . By Laurent's theorem, then, .  Since has an antiderivative for all except when , all the terms in the preceding expression drop out except when , giving    The uniqueness of the Laurent series is an important property because the coefficients in the Laurent expansion of a function are seldom found by using Equation . The following examples illustrate some methods for finding Laurent series coefficients.    Find three different Laurent series representations for involving powers of .    The function has singularities at and is analytic in the disk , in the annulus , and in the region . We want to find a different Laurent series for in each of the three domains , , and . We start by writing in its partial fraction form: .  We use Theorem and Corollary to obtain the following representations for the terms on the right side of Equation : .  Representations and are both valid in the disk , and thus we have , which is a Laurent series that reduces to a Maclaurin series. In the annulus , Representations and are valid; hence we get .  Finally, in the region we use Representations and to obtain .      Find the Laurent series representation for that involves powers of .    We use the Maclaurin series for to write .

  "body": " Singularities, Zeros, and Poles  Recall that the point is called a singular point, or singularity, of the complex function if is not analytic at the point , but every neighborhood of contains at least one point at which is analytic. For example, the function is not analytic at but is analytic for all other values of . Thus the point is a singular point of . As another example, consider the function Log . We showed in Section 5.2 that is analytic for all except at the origin and at the points on the negative real axis. Thus the origin and each point on the negative real axis are singularities of .  The point is called an isolated singularity of a complex function if is not analytic at but there exists a real number such that is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk . The function has an isolated singularity at . The function Log , however, has a singularity at (or at any point of the negative real axis) that is not isolated, because any neighborhood of contains points on the negative real axis, and is not analytic at those points. Functions with isolated singularities have a Laurent series because the punctured disk is the same as the annulus . We now look at this special case of Laurent's theorem in order to classify three types of isolated singularities.   Classification of singularities   Let have an isolated singularity at with Laurent series . Then we distinguish the following types of singularities at .   i  If , for , then has a removable singularity at .    ii  If is a positive integer such that , but for , then has a pole of order at .    iii  If for infinitely many negative integers , then has an essential singularity at .       Let's investigate some examples of these three cases.   i  If has a removable singularity at , then it has a Laurent series . Theorem implies that the power series for defines an analytic function in the disk . If we use this series to define , then the function becomes analytic at , removing the singularity. For example, consider the function . It is undefined at and has an isolated singularity at , as the Laurent series for is . We can remove this singularity if we define , for then will be analytic at in accordance with Theorem . Another example is , which has an isolated singularity at the point , as the Laurent series for is . If we define , then will be analytic for all .    ii  If has a pole of order at , the Laurent series for is , where . For example, has a pole of order 2 at . If has a pole of order 1 at , we say that has a simple pole at . For example, , which has a simple pole at .    iii  If infinitely many negative powers of occur in the Laurent series, then has an essential singularity at . For example, has an essential singularity at the origin.      Zero of order $k$   A function analytic in has a zero of order at the point iff .  A zero of order 1 is called a simple zero.      A function analytic in has a zero of order at the point iff its Taylor series given by has .     The conclusion follows immediately from Definition 7.6, because we have according to Taylor's theorem.     From Theorem we see that the function has a zero of order 3 at . Definition 7.6 confirms this fact because   Then, , but .      Suppose that the function is analytic in . Then has a zero of order \\ at the point iff can be expressed in the form , where is analytic at the point and .     Suppose that has a zero of order at the point , and that for . Theorem assures us that for , and that , so that we can write as , where . The series on the right side of Equation defines a function, which we denote by . That is, . By Theorem , is analytic in , and .  Conversely, suppose that has the form given by Equation . Since is analytic at , it has the power series representation , where by assumption. If we multiply both sides of the expression defining by we get . By Theorem , has a zero of order at the point .   An immediate consequence of Theorem is Corollary . The proof is left as an exercise.    If and are analytic at and have zeros of orders and , respectively, at , then their product has a zero of order at .      Let . Then can be factored as the product of and , which have zeros of orders and , respectively, at . Hence is a zero of order 4 of .     Theorem gives a useful way to characterize a pole.    A function analytic in the punctured disk has a pole of order at the point iff can be expressed in the form , where the function is analytic at the point , and .     Suppose that has a pole of order at the point . We can then write the Laurent series for as , where . The series on the right side of this equation defines a function, which we denote by . That is, . If we specify that , then is analytic in all of , with .  Conversely, suppose that Equation is satisfied. Because is analytic at the point with , it has a power series representation , where . If we divide both sides of this equation by , we obtain the following Laurent series representation for : , where . Since , has a pole of order at .   The following corollaries \\big(  \\big) are useful in determining the order of a zero or a pole. The proofs follow easily from Theorems and , and are left as exercises.    If is analytic and has a zero of order at the point , then has a pole of order at .      If has a pole of order at the point , then has a removable singularity at . If we define , then has a zero of order at .      If and have poles of orders and , respectively, at the point , then their product has a pole of order at .      Let and be analytic with zeros of orders and , respectively, at . Then their quotient has the following behavior:   i  If , then has a removable singularity at .

  "body": " Applications of Taylor and Laurent Series  In this section we show how you can use Taylor and Laurent series to derive important properties of analytic functions. We begin by showing that the zeros of an analytic function must be isolated unless the function is identically zero. A point of a set is called isolated if there exists a disk about that does not contain any other points of .    Suppose that is analytic in a domain containing and that . If is not identically zero in , then there exists a punctured disk in which has no zeros.     By Taylor's theorem, there exists some disk about such that . If all the Taylor coefficients of were zero, then would be identically zero on . A proof similar to the proof of the maximum modulus principle ( Theorem ) would then show that is identically zero in , contradicting our assumption about .  Thus, not all the Taylor coefficients of are zero, and we may select the smallest integer such that . According to the results in Section , has a zero of order at and can be written in the form , where is analytic at and . Since is a continuous function, there exists a disk throughout which is nonzero. Therefore in the punctured disk .   The proofs of the following two corollaries are given as exercises.    Suppose that is analytic in the domain and that . If there exists a sequence of points such that , and , then for all .      Suppose that and are analytic in the domain , where . If there exists a sequence such that , and for all , then for all .     Theorem also allows us to give a simple argument for one version of L'Hôpital's rule.    (L'Hôpital's rule) Suppose that and are analytic at . If and , but , then      Because , is not identically zero and, by Theorem , there is a punctured disk in which . Thus the quotient is defined for all , and we can write .   We can use the following Theorem to get Taylor series for quotients of analytic functions. Its proof involves ideas from Section , and we leave it as an exercise.   Division of power series   Suppose that and are analytic at with the power series representations .  If , then the quotient has the power series representation , where the coefficients satisfy the equation .  In other words, we can obtain the series for the quotient by the familiar process of dividing the series for by the series for , using the standard long division algorithm.      Find the first few terms of the Maclaurin series for the function , if , and compute .    Using long division, we see that .  Using Taylor's theorem, we see that if , then , so that .    We close this section with some results concerning the behavior of complex functions at points near the different types of isolated singularities. The following is due to the German mathematician G. F. Bernhard Riemann (1826 1866).   Riemann   Suppose that is analytic in . If is bounded in , then either is analytic at or has a removable singularity at .     Consider the function , defined as   Clearly, is analytic in at least . Straightforward calculation yields .  The last equation follows because is bounded. Thus is also analytic at , with .  By Taylor's theorem, has the representation .  We divide both sides of Equation by and use Equation to obtain the following power series representation for : .  By Theorem , is analytic at if we define . This observation completes the proof.   The proof of the following Corollary is given as an exercise.    If is analytic in , then can be defined to be analytic at iff exists and is finite.      Suppose that is analytic in . The function has a pole of order at , iff .     Suppose, first, that has a pole of order at . Using Theorem , we can say that , where is analytic at , and . Because and , we conclude that .  Conversely, suppose that . By the definition of a limit, there must be some such that if . Thus the function is analytic and bounded (because ) in . By Theorem , we may define at so that is analytic in all of . In fact, , so is a zero of . We claim that must be of finite order; otherwise, we would have , for all , and hence , for all . As is analytic in , this result is impossible, so we can let be the order of the zero of at . By Corollary , has a pole of order .     The function has an essential singularity at iff does not exist.     From Corollary and Theorem , the conclusion of Theorem is the only option possible.     Show that the function defined by is not continuous at .    In Exercise 20, Section , we asked you to show this relation by computing limits along the real and imaginary axes. Note, however, that the Laurent series for in the annulus is , so that is an essential singularity for . According to Theorem , doesn't exist, so is not continuous at .     Exercises   Determine whether there exists a function that is analytic at with the property that, for ,   and .  No. Otherwise . On the other hand, . Justify and explain.    .  Yes.

  "title": "The Residue Theorem",
  "body": " The Residue Theorem  The Cauchy integral formulas given in Section are useful in evaluating contour integrals over a simple closed contour where the integrand has the form and is an analytic function. In this case, the singularity of the integrand is at worst a pole of order at . We begin this section by extending this result to integrals that have a finite number of isolated singularities inside the contour . This new method can be used in cases where the integrand has an essential singularity at and is an important extension of the previous method.   Residue   Let have a nonremovable isolated singularity at the point . Then has the Laurent series representation for all in some disk given by . The coefficient is called the residue of at . We use the notation .      If , then the Laurent series of about the point 0 has the form ,. and .      Find if .    Using the techniques of Example , we find that has three Laurent series representations involving powers of . In the punctured disk , . Computing the first few coefficients, we obtain . Therefore, .    Recall that, for a function analytic in and for any with , the Laurent series coefficients of are given by , where denotes the circle with positive orientation. This result gives us an important fact concerning . If we set in Equation and replace with any positively oriented simple closed contour containing , provided is the still only singularity of that lies inside , then we obtain .  If we are able to find the Laurent series expansion for , then Equation gives us an important tool for evaluating contour integrals.    Evaluate .     Example showed that the residue of at is . Using Equation , we get      Cauchy 's residue theorem   Let be a simply connected domain and let be a simple closed positively oriented contour that lies in . If is analytic inside and on , except at the points that lie inside , then . The situation is illustrated in Figure .     The domain and contour and the singular points in the statement of Cauchy 's residue theorem     Since there are a finite number of singular points inside , there exists an such that the positively oriented circles , for , are mutually disjoint and all lie inside . From the extended Cauchy-Goursat theorem ( Theorem on page ), it follows that . The function is analytic in a punctured disk with center that contains the circle , so we can use Equation to obtain . Combining the last two equations gives the desired result.   The domain and contour and the singular points in the statement of Cauchy 's residue theorem.  The calculation of a Laurent series expansion is tedious in most circumstances. As the residue at involves only the coefficient in the Laurent expansion, we seek a method to calculate the residue from special information about the nature of the singularity at .  If has a removable singularity at , then , for . Therefore, . The following theorem gives methods for evaluating residues at poles.   Residues at Poles     i  If has a simple pole at , then .    ii  If has a pole of order at , then .    iii  If has a pole of order at , then .       If has a simple pole at , then the Laurent series is . If we multiply both sides of this equation by and take the limit as , we obtain . which establishes part ( i ). We proceed to part ( iii ), as part ( ii ) is a special case of it. Suppose that has a pole of order at . Then can be written as . Multiplying both sides of this equation by gives . If we differentiate both sides times we get . and when we let the result is , which establishes part ( iii ).     Find the residue of at .    We write . Because has a zero of order at and , has a pole of order at . By part ( iii ) of Theorem 8.2, we have .  This last limit involves an indeterminate form, which we evaluate by using L'Hôpital's rule: .      Find .    We write the integrand as . The singularities of that lie inside are simple poles at the points and , and a pole of order at the origin. We compute the residues as follows: .  Finally, the residue theorem yields .  The answer is not at all obvious, and all the preceding calculations are required to get it.      Find .   The singularities of the integrand that lie inside are simple poles occurring at the points , as the points lie outside . Factoring the denominator is tedious, so we use a different approach. If is any one of the singularities of , then we can use L'Hôpital's rule to compute :    . Since , we can simplify this expression further to yield . Hence , and . We now use the residue theorem to get     The theory of residues can be used to expand the quotient of two polynomials into its partial fraction representation.    Let be a polynomial of degree at most . Show that if , and are distinct complex numbers, then .    It will suffice to prove that $.      Express in partial fractions.    Computing the residues, we obtain .   Example gives us      If a repeated root occurs, then the process is similar, and we can easily show that if has degree of at most , then , where  , , and .

We let be a continuous function of the real variable on the interval . Recall from calculus that the improper integral over is defined by , provided the limit exists. If is defined for all real , then the integral of over is defined by , provided both limits exist. If the integral in Equation exists, we can obtain its value by taking a single limit: .  The following example shows that, for some functions, the limit on the right side of Equation exists, but the limit on the right side of Equation doesn't exist.     , but Equation tells us that the improper integral of over doesn't exist. Therefore we can use Equation to extend the notion of the value of an improper integral, as Definition indicates.     Cauchy principal value   Let be a continuous real-valued function for all . The Cauchy principal value (P.V.) of the integral is defined by , provided the limit exists.     Example showed that P.V. .    The Cauchy principal value of is .

Using the trigonometric identity and Equations , we express the integral on the right side of Inequality as .  On the interval we can use the inequality . We combine this inequality with Inequality and Equation to conclude that, for , .  Because is arbitrary, the proof of Jordan's lemma is complete.   We now turn to the proof of our main Theorem.

  "body": " Integrands with Branch Points  We now show how to evaluate certain improper real integrals involving the integrand . The complex function is multivalued, so we must first specify the branch to be used.  Let be a real number with . In this section we use the branch of corresponding to the branch of the logarithm \\big(see Equation \\big) as follows: . where and . Note that this is not the traditional principal branch of and that, as defined, the function is analytic in the domain .    Let and be polynomials of degree and , respectively, where . If , for has a zero of order at most at the origin, and , where , then , where are the nonzero poles of .     Let denote the simple closed positively oriented contour that consists of the portions of the circles and and the horizontal segments joining them, per Figure .   Contour encloses the nonzero poles of    We select a small value of and a large value of so that the nonzero poles of lie inside . Using the residue theorem, we write .  If we let in Equation , the integrand on the upper horizontal line of Figure approaches , where is a real number; however, because of the branch we chose for (see Equation ), the integrand on the lower horizontal line approaches . Therefore .  It is here that we need the function to have a zero of order at most 1 at the origin. Otherwise, the first two integrals on the right side of Equation would not necessarily converge. Combining this result with Equation gives , so , which we rewrite as .  Using the ML inequality ( Theorem ) gives .  The argument is essentially the same as that used to establish Equation , and we omit the details. If we combine Equations and and let , we arrive at the desired result.     Evaluate P.V. , where .    The function has a nonzero pole at the point , and the denominator has a zero of order at most 1 (in fact, exactly 1) at the origin. Using Theorem , we compute .    We can apply the preceding ideas to other multivalued functions.    Evaluate P.V. , where .   We use the function . Recall that , where and . The path of integration will consist of the segments and of the -axis together with the upper semicircles and , for , as shown in Figure .    The contour for the integrand    We chose the branch because it is analytic on and its interior, hence so is the function . This choice enables us to apply the residue theorem properly (see the hypotheses of Theorem ), and we get . Keeping in mind the branch of logarithm that we're using, we then have .  If , then by the ML inequality ( Theorem ) , and L'Hôpital's rule yields . Engaging in a similar computation shows that . We use these results when we take limits Equations to get .  Equating the real parts in this equation gives      The theory of this section is not purely esoteric. Many applications of contour integrals surface in government and industry worldwide. Several years ago, for example, a briefing was given at the Korean Institute for Defense Analysis (KIDA) in which a sophisticated problem was analyzed by means of a contour integral whose path of integration was virtually identical to that given in Figure .

  "title": "The Argument Principle &amp; Rouché’s Theorem",
  "body": " The Argument Principle & Rouché's Theorem  We now derive two results based on Cauchy 's residue theorem. They have important practical applications and pertain only to functions all of whose isolated singularities are poles.   Meromorphic function   A function is said to be meromorphic in a domain provided the only singularities of are isolated poles and removable singularities.    We make three important observations relating to this definition.   Analytic functions are a special case of meromorphic functions.    Rational functions , where and are polynomials, are meromorphic in the entire complex plane.    By definition, meromorphic functions have no essential singularities.     Suppose that is analytic at each point on a simple closed contour and is meromorphic in the domain that is the interior of . We assert without proof that Theorem can be extended to meromorphic functions so that has at most a finite number of zeros that lie inside . Since the function is also meromorphic, it can have only a finite number of zeros inside , and so can have at most a finite number of poles that lie inside .  The following theorem, known as the argument principle, is useful in determining the number of zeros and poles that a function has.   argument principle   Suppose that is meromorphic in the simply connected domain and that is a simple closed positively oriented contour in such that has no zeros or poles for . Then , where is the number of zeros of that lie inside and is the number of poles of that lie inside .     Let be the zeros of inside counted according to multiplicity and let be the poles of inside counted according to multiplicity. Then has the representation , where is analytic and nonzero on and inside . A standard calculation shows that .   Corollary then gives .  The function is analytic inside and on , so the Cauchy-Goursat theorem gives . These facts lead to the conclusion of our theorem if we integrate both sides of Equation over .     Suppose that is analytic in the simply connected domain . Let be a simple closed positively oriented contour in such that for , . Then , where is the number of zeros of that lie inside .     Certain feedback control systems in engineering must be stable. A test for stability involves the function , where is a rational function. If does not have any zeros in the region , then the system is stable. We determine the number of zeros of by writing , where and are polynomials with no common zero. Then , and we can check for the zeros of by using Theorem . We select a value so that for and then integrate along the contour consisting of the right half of the circle and the line segment between and . This method is known as the Nyquist stability criterion .   Why do we label Theorem as the argument principle ? The answer lies with a fascinating application known as the winding number . Recall that a branch of the logarithm function, , is defined by , where and . Loosely speaking, suppose that for some branch of the logarithm, the composite function were analytic in a simply connected domain containing the contour . This would imply that is an antiderivative of the function for all . Theorems and would then tell us that, as winds around the curve , the quantity would change by . Since is purely imaginary, this result tells us that would change by radians. In other words, as winds around , the integral would count how many times the curve winds around the origin.  Unfortunately, we can't always claim that is an antiderivative of the function for all . If it were, the Cauchy-Goursat theorem would imply that . Nevertheless, the heuristics that we gave indicating that counts how many times the curve winds around the origin still hold true, as we now demonstrate.  Suppose that for is a simple closed contour and that we let be a partition of the interval . For , we let denote the corresponding points on , where . If lies inside , then the curve winds around once as goes from to , as shown in Figure .  Now suppose that a function is analytic at each point on and meromorphic inside . Then is a closed curve in the plane that passes through the points , for , where . We can choose subintervals small enough so that, on the portion of between and , we can define a continuous branch of the logarithm , where and , as shown in Figure . Then , where measures in radians the amount that the portion of the curve between and winds around the origin. With small enough subintervals , the angles and might be different, but the values and will be the same, so that .   The points on the contour that winds around    We can now show why counts the number of times that winds around the origin. We parametrize , for , and choose the appropriate branches of ,giving . which we rewrite as .  When we use the fact that , the first summation in Equation vanishes. The summation of the quantities expresses the accumulated radian measure of around the origin. Therefore, when we divide both sides of Equation by , its right side becomes an integer (by Theorem ) that must count the number of times winds around the origin.    The image of the circle under is the curve given by shown in Figure .   The image curve under    Note that the image curve winds twice around the origin. We check this by computing . The residues of the integrand are at and . Thus .    Finally, we note that if , then , and thus we can generalize what we've just said to compute how many times the curve winds around the point . Theorem summarizes our discussion.   winding numbers   Suppose that is meromorphic in the simply connected domain . If is a simple closed positively oriented contour in \\ such that for , and , then , known as the winding number of { } about , counts the number of times the curve winds around the point . If , the integral counts the number of times the curve winds around the origin.     Letting in Theorem gives which counts the number of times the curve winds around the point . If is not a simple closed curve, but crosses itself perhaps several times, we can show (but omit the proof) that still gives the number of times the curve winds around the point . Thus winding number is indeed an appropriate term.   We close this section with a result that will help us gain information about the location of the zeros and poles of meromorphic functions.   Rouché's theorem   Suppose that and are meromorphic functions defined in the simply connected domain , that is a simply closed contour in , and that and have no zeros or poles for . If the strict inequality holds for all , then .     Because has no zeros or poles on , we may legitimately divide both sides of the inequality by to get .  For cannot possibly be zero or any positive real number, as that would contradict Inequality . This means that , the image of the curve under the mapping , does not contain the interval , and so the function defined by , where and , is analytic in a simply connected domain that contains . We calculate , so is an antiderivative of , for all . Since is a closed curve in , Theorem gives . According to Theorem then, , which completes the proof.     Suppose that and are analytic functions defined in the simply connected domain , that is a simple closed contour in , and that and have no zeros for . If the strict inequality holds for all , then .      Theorem is usually stated with the requirement that and satisfy the condition , for . The improved theorem that we gave was discovered by Irving Glicksberg (see the American Mathematical Monthly , 83 (1976), pp. 186-187). The weaker version is adequate for most purposes, however, as the following examples illustrate.     Show that all four zeros of the polynomial lie in the disk .    Let . Then , and at points on the circle we have the relation . Of course, if , then as we indicated in Remark we certainly have , so that the conditions for applying Corollary are satisfied on the circle . The function has a zero of order at the origin, so must have four zeros inside .      Show that the polynomial has one zero in the disk .    Let , then . At points on the circle we have the relation . The function has one zero at the point in the disk , and the hypotheses of Corollary hold on the circle . Therefore has one zero inside .

If is near , then the transformation has the linear approximation , where and . Because when , for points near the transformation has an effect much like the linear mapping . The effect of the linear mapping is a rotation of the plane through the angle , followed by a magnification by the factor , followed by a rigid translation by the vector . Consequently, the mapping preserves the angles at the point . We now show that the mapping also preserves angles at .  Let , denote a smooth curve that passes through the point . A vector tangent to at the point is given by , where the complex number is expressed as a vector.  The angle of inclination of with respect to the positive -axis is   The image of under the mapping is the curve given by the formula . We can use the chain rule to show that a vector tangent to at the point is given by   The angle of inclination of with respect to the positive -axis is , where . Therefore the effect of the transformation is to rotate the angle of inclination of the tangent vector at through the angle to obtain the angle of inclination of the tangent vector at . This situation is illustrated in Figure .   Tangents at the points and , where    A mapping is said to be angle preserving, or conformal at , if it preserves angles between oriented curves in magnitude as well as in orientation. Theorem shows where a mapping by an analytic function is conformal.    Let be an analytic function in the domain , and let be a point in . If , then is conformal at .     We let and be two smooth curves passing through with tangents given by and , respectively. We let and denote the angles of inclination of and , respectively.  The image curves and that pass through the point have tangents denoted and , respectively. From Equation , the angles of inclination and of and are related to and by the equations , where . From Equations we conclude that .   The analytic mapping is conformal at the point , where because the angle from to is the same in magnitude and orientation as the angle from to . This situation is shown in Figure .   Angle preservation when      Show that the mapping is conformal at the points , , and , and determine the angle of rotation given by at the given points.

If and are two smooth curves that pass through , and and are their images, then from Equation it follows that   That is, the angle from to is times as large as the angle from to . Therefore angles at the vertex are magnified by the factor . This situation is shown in Figure .

Another property of a conformal mapping is obtained by considering the modulus of . If is near , we can use Equation and neglect the term . We then have the approximation .  From Equation , the distance between the images of the points and is given approximately by . Therefore we say that the transformation changes small distances near by the scale factor  . For example, the scale factor of the transformation near the point is .  We also need to say a few things about the inverse transformation of a conformal mapping near a point , where . A complete justification of the following assertions relies on theorems studied in advanced calculus. See, for instance, R. Creighton Buck, Advanced Calculus , 3rd ed.

The mapping in Equations represents a transformation from the plane into the plane, and the Jacobian determinant,  , is defined by   The transformation in Equations has a local inverse, provided . Expanding Equation and using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we obtain .  Consequently, Equations and imply that a local inverse exists in a neighborhood of the point .

  "title": "Bilinear Transformations",
  "body": " Bilinear Transformations   Another important class of elementary mappings was studied by Augustus Ferdinand Möbius (1790 1868). These mappings are conveniently expressed as the quotient of two linear expressions. They arise naturally in mapping problems involving the function . In this section, we show how they are used to map a disk one-to-one and onto a half-plane.  If we let , and denote four complex constants with the restriction that , then the function is called a bilinear transformation, a Möbius transformation , or a linear fractional transformation. If the expression for in Equation is multiplied by the quantity , then the resulting expression has the bilinear form . We collect terms involving and write . Then, for values of , the inverse transformation is given by .  We can extend and to mappings in the extended complex plane. The value should equal the limit of as . Therefore we define , and the inverse is . Similarly, the value is obtained by , and the inverse is . With these extensions we conclude that the transformation is a one-to-one mapping of the extended complex plane onto the extended complex plane.  We now show that a bilinear transformation carries the class of circles and lines onto itself. If is an arbitrary bilinear transformation given by Equation and , then reduces to a linear transformation, which carries lines onto lines and circles onto circles. If , then we can write in the form .  The condition precludes the possibility that reduces to a constant. Equation indicates that can be considered as a composition of functions. It is a linear mapping , followed by the reciprocal transformation , followed by . In we showed that each function in this composition maps the class of circles and lines onto itself; it follows that the bilinear transformation has this property. A half-plane can be considered to be a family of parallel lines and a disk as a family of circles. Therefore we conclude that a bilinear transformation maps the class of half-planes and disks onto itself. Example illustrates this idea.    Show that maps the unit disk one-to-one and onto the upper half-plane .   We first consider the unit circle , which forms the boundary of the disk and find its image in the plane. If we write , then we see that , and . Using Equation , we find that the inverse is given by .   If , then Equation implies that the images of points on the unit circle satisfy the equation .  Squaring both sides of Equation , we obtain , which can be simplified to yield , which is the equation of the -axis in the plane.  The circle divides the plane into two portions, and its image is the -axis, which divides the plane into two portions. The image of the point is , so we expect that the interior of the circle is mapped onto the portion of the plane that lies above the -axis. To show that this outcome is true, we let . Then Equation implies that the image values must satisfy the inequality , which we write as .  If we interpret as the distance from to and as the distance from to , then a geometric argument shows that the image point must lie in the upper half-plane , as shown in Figure . As is one-to-one and onto in the extended complex plane, it follows that maps the disk onto the half-plane.     The image of under    The general formula for a bilinear transformation (Equation ) appears to involve four independent coefficients: , and . But as , either or , we can express the transformation with three unknown coefficients and write either , respectively. Doing so permits us to determine a unique a bilinear transformation if three distinct image values , and are specified. To determine such a mapping, we can conveniently use an implicit formula involving and .   The implicit formula   There exists a unique bilinear transformation that maps three distinct points, , , and , onto three distinct points, , , and , respectively. An implicit formula for the mapping is given by .     We algebraically manipulate Equation and solve for in terms of . The result is an expression for that has the form of Equation , where the coefficients , , , and involve various combinations of the values , and . The details are left as an exercise.  If we set and in Equation , then both sides of the equation are zero, showing that is the image of . If we set and in Equation , then both sides of the equation take on the value . Hence is the image of . Taking reciprocals, we write Equation in the form .  If we set and in Equation , then both sides of the equation are zero. Therefore is the image of , and we have shown that the transformation has the required properties.     Construct the bilinear transformation that maps the points , , and onto the points , , and , respectively.    We use the implicit formula (Equation ) and write   Expanding this equation, we obtain .  Then, collecting terms involving and on the left results in , from which we obtain . Therefore the desired bilinear transformation is       Find the bilinear transformation that maps the points , and onto , and , respectively.    Again, we use the implicit formula and write . Using the fact that , we rewrite this equation as . We now expand the equation and obtain , which can be solved for in terms of , giving the desired solution     We let be a region in the plane that is bounded by either a circle or a straight line . We further let , , and be three distinct points that lie on and have the property that an observer moving along from to through finds the region to be on the left. If is a circle and is the interior of , then we say that is positively oriented. Conversely, the ordered triple uniquely determines a region that lies to the left of .  We let be a region in the plane that is bounded by either a circle of a straight line . We further let , , and be three distinct points that lie on such that an observer moving along from to through finds the region to be on the left. Because a bilinear transformation is a conformal mapping that maps the class of circles and straight lines onto itself, we can use the implicit formula to construct a bilinear transformation that is a one-to-one mapping of onto .    Show that the mapping maps the disk onto the upper half-plane .    For convenience, we choose the ordered triple , , and , which gives the circle a positive orientation and the disk a left orientation. From Example 9.5, the corresponding image points are .  Because the ordered triple of points , , and lie on the -axis, it follows that the image of circle is the -axis. The points , , and give the upper half-plane : a left orientation. Therefore maps the disk onto the upper half-plane . To check our work, we choose a point that lies in and find the half-plane in which its image, , lies. The choice yields . Hence the upper half-plane is the correct image. This situation is illustrated in Figure .     The bilinear mapping      (The implicit formula with a point at infinity) In Equation , the point at infinity can be introduced as one of the prescribed points in either the plane or the plane.      Case 1 If , then we can write and substitute this expression into Equation to obtain    Case 2 If , then we can write and substitute this expression into Equation to obtain .   Equation is sometimes used to map the crescent-shaped region that lies between the tangent circles onto an infinite strip.    Find the bilinear transformation that maps the crescent-shaped region that lies inside the disk and outside the circle onto a horizontal strip.    For convenience we choose , , and and the image values , , and , respectively. The ordered triple , , and gives the circle a positive orientation and the disk has a left orientation. The image points , , and all lie on the extended -axis, and they determine a left orientation for the upper half-plane . Therefore we can use the second implicit formula given in Equation to write , which determines a mapping of the disk onto the upper half-plane . We simplify the preceding equation to obtain the desired solution:   A straightforward calculation shows that the points , and are mapped onto the points , respectively. The points , and lie on the horizontal line in the upper half-plane. Therefore the crescent-shaped region is mapped onto the horizontal strip , as shown in Figure .     The mapping      Lines of Flux  In electronics, images of certain lines represent lines of electric flux, which comprise the trajectory of an electron placed in an electrical field. Consider the bilinear transformation   The half rays , where is a constant, that meet at the origin represent the lines of electric flux produced by a source located at (and a sink at ). The preimage of this family of lines is a family of circles that pass through the points and . We visualize these circles as the lines of electric flux from one point charge to another.

  "body": " Mappings Involving Elementary Functions   In Section we showed that the function is a one-to-one mapping of the fundamental period strip in the plane onto the plane with the point deleted. Because , the mapping is a conformal mapping at each point in the complex plane. The family of horizontal lines for and the segments for form an orthogonal grid in the fundamental period strip. Their images under the mapping are the rays and and the circles , respectively. These images form an orthogonal curvilinear grid in the plane, as shown in Figure . If , then the rectangle is mapped one-to-one and onto the region . The inverse mapping is the principal branch of the logarithm .   The conformal mapping    In this section we show how compositions of conformal transformations are used to construct mappings with specified characteristics.    Show that the transformation is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the horizontal strip onto the disk . Furthermore, the -axis is mapped onto the lower semicircle bounding the disk, and the line is mapped onto the upper semicircle.    The function is the composition of followed by . The transformation maps the horizontal strip onto the upper half plane ; the -axis is mapped on to the positive -axis; and the line is mapped onto the negative -axis. Then the bilinear transformation maps the upper half plane onto the disk , the positive -axis is mapped onto the lower semicircle; and the negative -axis onto the upper semicircle. Figures and illustrate the composite mappings.      Show that the transformation is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the unit disk onto the horizontal strip . Furthermore, the upper semicircle of the disk is mapped onto the line and the lower semicircle onto .   The composite transformation     The composite transformation      The function is the composition of the bilinear transformation followed by the logarithmic mapping . The image of the disk under the bilinear mapping is the right half-plane ; the upper semicircle is mapped onto the positive -axis; and the lower semicircle is mapped onto the negative -axis. The logarithmic function then maps the right half-plane onto the horizontal strip, the image of the positive -axis is the line , and the image of the negative -axis is the line . Figures 9.11 and 9.12 illustrate the composite mappings.      Show that the transformation is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the portion of the disk that lies in the upper half-plane onto the upper half-plane . Furthermore, show that the image of the semicircular portion of the boundary is mapped onto the negative -axis, and the segment , is mapped onto the positive -axis.    The function is the composition of the bilinear transformation followed by the mapping . The image of the half-disk under the bilinear mapping is the first quadrant , ; the image of the segment , , is the positive -axis; and the image of the semicircle is the positive -axis. The mapping then maps the first quadrant in the plane onto the upper half-plane , as shown in Figure .     The composite transformation      Consider the function , which is the composition of the functions and , where the branch of the square root is given by the formula , for . Show that the transformation maps the upper half-plane one-to-one and onto the upper half-plane slit along the segment .    The function maps the upper half-plane one-to-one and onto the -plane slit along the ray , . Then the function maps the slit plane onto the slit half-plane, as shown in Figure .     The composite transformation and the intermediate steps and     The images of the horizontal lines are curves in the plane that bend around the segment from to . The curves represent the streamlines of a fluid flowing across the plane. We discuss fluid flows in more detail in Section .     The Mapping  The double-valued function has a branch that is continuous for values of distant from the origin. This feature is spurred by our desire for the approximation to hold for values of distant from the origin. We begin by expressing as , where the principal branch of the square root function is used in both factors. We claim that the mapping is a one-to-one conformal mapping from the domain set , consisting of the plane slit along the segment , onto the range set , consisting of the plane slit along the segment . To verify this claim, we investigate the two formulas on the right side of Equation and express them in the form , where and , and , where and .  The discontinuities of and are points on the real axis such that and , respectively. We now show that is continuous on the ray .  We let denote a point on the ray , and then obtain the following limits as approaches from the upper and lower half-planes, respectively: { ,  } and { .  Both limits agree with the value of , so it follows that is continuous along the ray .  We can easily find the inverse mapping and express it similarly: , where the branches of the square root function are given by , where , and , and , where , and .  A similar argument shows that is continuous for all except those points that lie on the segment . Verification that hold for in and in , respectively, is straightforward. Therefore we conclude that is a one-to-one mapping from onto . Verifying that is also analytic on the ray , is tedious. We leave it as a challenging exercise.    The Riemann Surface for  Using the other branch of the square root, we find that is a one-to-one conformal mapping from the domain set , consisting of the plane slit along the segment , onto the range set , consisting of the plane slit along the segment , . Figure shows the sets and for and and for .  We obtain the Riemann surface for by gluing the edges of and together and the edges of and together. In the domain set, we glue edges to to to , and to . In the image set, we glue edges to , to , to , and to . The result is a Riemann domain surface and Riemann image surface for the mapping, as illustrated in Figures (a) and (b), respectively.

  "title": "Mapping by Trigonometric Functions",
  "body": " Mapping by Trigonometric Functions   The trigonometric functions can be expressed with compositions that involve the exponential function followed by a bilinear function. We can find images of certain regions by following the shapes of successive images in the composite mapping. We begin with the tangent function, and make use of the following figure.   The composite transformation      Show that the transformation is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the vertical strip onto the unit disk .     . Then, mapping can be considered to be the composition . The function maps the vertical strip one-to-one and onto the right half-plane . Then the bilinear transformation given by maps the half-plane one-to-one and onto the disk, as shown in Figure .      Show that the transformation is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the vertical strip onto the plane slit along the rays , and .    Because for values of satisfying the inequality , it follows that is a conformal mapping. Using Equation 5, we write   If , then the image of the vertical line is the curve in the plane given by the parametric equations , for . Next, we rewrite these equations as   We now eliminate from these equations by squaring and using the hyperbolic identity . The result is the single equation .  The curve given by Equation is identified as a hyperbola in the plane that has foci at the points . Therefore the vertical line is mapped one-to-one onto the branch of the hyperbola given by Equation that passes through the point . If  , then it is the right branch; if , it is the left branch. The image of the -axis, which is the line , is the -axis. The images of several vertical lines are shown in Figure (a).   The transformation w =    The image of the horizontal segment is the curve in the plane given by the parametric equations for . We rewrite them as   We now eliminate from the equations by squaring and using the trigonometric identity . The result is the single equation .  The curve given by Equation is identified as an ellipse in the plane that passes through the points and and has foci at the points . Therefore, if , then , and the image of the horizontal segment is the portion of the ellipse given by Equation that lies in the upper half-plane . If , then it is the portion that lies in the lower half-plane. Figure (b) shows the images of several segments.      The Complex Arcsine Function  We now develop explicit formulas for the real and imaginary parts of the principal value of the arcsine function . We use this mapping to solve problems involving steady temperatures and ideal fluid flow in Section 9.7. The mapping is found by solving the equation for and expressed as functions of and . To solve for , we first equate the real and imaginary parts of Equation and obtain the equations   Then we eliminate from these equations and obtain the single equation .  If we treat as a constant, this equation represents a hyperbola in the plane, the foci occur at the points , and the transverse axis is given by . Therefore a point on the hyperbola must satisfy the equation   The quantity on the right side of this equation is the difference of the distances from to and from to . We now solve the equation for to obtain the real part: .  The principal branch of the real function is used in Equation , where the range values satisfy the inequality .  Similarly, we can start with Equation and obtain the equations . We then eliminate from these equations and obtain the single equation .  If we treat as a constant, then this equation represents an ellipse in the plane, the foci occur at the points , and the major axis has length . Therefore a point on this ellipse must satisfy the equation . The quantity on the right side of this equation is the sum of the distances from to and from to .  The function maps points in the upper half (lower half) of the vertical strip onto the upper half-plane (lower half-plane), respectively. Hence we can solve the preceding equation and obtain as a function of and : , where , if , and , if . In Equation we use the real function given by , with .  Thus, the mapping is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the plane cut along the rays , and , onto the vertical strip in the -plane, which can be construed from Figure if we interchange the roles of the and planes. The image of the square , under , is shown in Figure . We obtained it by plotting the two families of curves and , where , . The formulas in Equations and are also convenient for evaluating , as shown in Example    The mapping      Find the principal value .    Using Formulas and , we get .  Therefore, we have .    Is there any reason to assume that there exists a conformal mapping for some specified domain onto another domain ? Our final theorem concerning the existence of conformal mappings is attributed to Riemann and is presented in Lars V. Ahlfors, Complex Analysis (New York: McGraw-Hill) , 1966.

  "title": "Two-Dimensional Mathematical Models",
  "body": " Two-Dimensional Mathematical Models  We now consider problems involving steady state heat flow, electrostatics, and ideal fluid flow that can be solved with conformal mapping techniques. Conformal mapping transforms a region in which the problem is posed to one in which the solution is easy to obtain. As our solutions involve only two independent variables, and , we first mention a basic assumption needed for the validity of the model.  The physical problems we just mentioned are real-world applications and involve solutions in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Such problems generally would involve the Laplacian in three variables and the divergence and curl of three-dimensional vector functions. Since complex analysis involves only and , we consider the special case in which the solution does not vary with the coordinate along the axis perpendicular to the plane. For steady state heat flow and electrostatics, this assumption means that the temperature, , or the potential, , varies only with and . Thus for the flow of ideal fluids, the fluid motion is the same in any plane that is parallel to the plane. Curves drawn in the plane are to be interpreted as cross sections that correspond to infinite cylinders perpendicular to the plane. An infinite cylinder is the limiting case of a long physical cylinder, so the mathematical model that we present is valid provided the three-dimensional problem involves a physical cylinder long enough that the effects at the ends can be reasonably neglected.  In Sections and , we showed how to obtain solutions for harmonic functions. For applications, we need to consider the family of level curves and the conjugate harmonic function and its family of level curves .  For convenience, we introduce the term complex potential for the analytic function   We use Theorem , regarding the orthogonality of the families of level curves ( Equations and ), to develop ideas concerning the physical applications that we will consider.   Orthogonal families of level curves   Suppose is harmonic in a domain , is its harmonic conjugate, and is the complex potential. Then the two families of level curves given in Equations and , respectively, are orthogonal in the sense that if is a point common to the two curves and , and if , then these two curves intersect orthogonally.     Since is an implicit equation of a plane curve, the gradient vector grad , evaluated at , is perpendicular to the curve at . This vector is given by   Similarly, the vector N defined by is orthogonal to the curve at . Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and , we have .  In addition, , so we have .  The Cauchy-Riemann equations and the facts and imply that both and are nonzero. Therefore Equation implies that is perpendicular to , and hence the curves are orthogonal.   The complex potential has many physical interpretations. Suppose, for example, that we have solved a problem in steady state temperatures. Then we can obtain the solution to a similar problem with the same boundary conditions in electrostatics by interpreting the isothermals as equipotential curves and the heat flow lines as flux lines. This implies that heat flow and electrostatics correspond directly.  Or suppose that we have solved a fluid flow problem. Then we can obtain a solution to an analogous problem in heat flow by interpreting the equipotentials as isothermals and streamlines as heat flow lines. Various interpretations of the families of level curves given in Equations and and correspondences between families are summarized in Table    Interpretations for Level Curves    Physical Phenomenon  constant  constant         Heat flow  Isothermals  Heat flow lines    Electrostatics  Equipotential curves  Flux lines    Fluid flow  Equipotentials  Streamlines    Gravitational field  Gravitational potential  Lines of force    Magnetism  Potential  Lines of force    Diffusion  Concentration  Lines of flow    Elasticity  Strain function  Stress lines    Current flow  Potential  Lines of flow          "

  "body": " Steady State Temperatures   In the theory of heat conduction, an assumption is made that heat flows in the direction of decreasing temperature. Another assumption is that the time rate at which heat flows across a surface area is proportional to the component of the temperature gradient in the direction perpendicular to the surface area. If the temperature does not depend on time, then the heat flow at the point is given by the vector , where is the thermal conductivity of the medium and is assumed to be constant. If denotes a straight-line segment of length , then the amount of heat flowing across the segment per unit of time is , where is the unit vector perpendicular to the segment.  If we assume that no thermal energy is created or destroyed within the region, then the net amount of heat flowing through any small rectangle with sides of length and is identically zero \\big(see Figure (a)\\big). This observation leads to the conclusion that is a harmonic function. The following heuristic argument is often used to suggest that satisfies Laplace's equation. Using Expression , we find that the amount of heat flowing out of the right edge of the rectangle in Figure (a) is approximately , and the amount of heat flowing out of the left edge is .  If we add the contributions in Equations and we get .   Steady state temperatures    Similarly, the contribution for the amount of heat flowing out of the top and bottom edges is .  Adding the quantities in Equations and , we find that the net heat flowing out of the rectangle is approximated by the equation , which implies that satisfies Laplace's equation and is a harmonic function.  If the domain in which is defined is simply connected, then a conjugate harmonic function exists, and is an analytic function. The curves are called isothermals and are lines connecting points of the same temperature. The curves are called heat flow lines, and we can visualize the heat flowing along these curves from points of higher temperature to points of lower temperature. The situation is illustrated in Figure (b).  Boundary value problems for steady state temperatures are realizations of the Dirichlet problem where the value of the harmonic function is interpreted as the temperature at the point .    Suppose that two parallel planes are perpendicular to the plane and pass through the horizontal lines and and that the temperature is held constant at the values and , respectively, on these planes. Then is given by    A reasonable assumption is that the temperature at all points on the plane passing through the line is constant. Hence , where is a function of alone. Laplace's equation implies that , and an argument similar to that in Example will show that the solution has the form given in the preceding equation.   The isothermals are easily seen to be horizontal lines. The conjugate harmonic function is , and the heat flow lines are vertical segments between the horizontal lines. If , then the heat flows along these segments from the plane through to the plane through , as illustrated in Figure .     The temperature between parallel planes where      Find the temperature at each point in the upper half-plane if the temperature along the axis satisfies .   Since is a harmonic function, this problem is an example of a Dirichlet problem. From Example 11.2, it follows that the solution is    The isotherms are rays emanating from the origin. The conjugate harmonic function is  , and the heat flow lines are semicircles centered at the origin. If , then the heat flows counterclockwise along the semicircles, as shown in Figure .     The temperature in the upper half-plane where      Find the temperature at each point in the upper half-disk if the temperatures at points on the boundary satisfy .   As discussed in Example , the function is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the half-disk onto the first quadrant . The conformal map given by Equation gives rise to a new problem of finding the temperature that satisfies the boundary conditions .  If we use Example 11.2, the harmonic function is given by .  Substituting the expressions for and from Equation into Equation yields the desired solution:    The isothermals constant are circles that pass through the points , as shown in Figure .     The temperature in a half-disk      An Insulated Segment on the Boundary  We now turn to the problem of finding the steady state temperature function inside the simply connected domain whose boundary consists of three adjacent curves , and , where along , and along . The region is insulated along , so that fact that no heat flows across implies that , where is perpendicular to . Thus the direction of heat flow must be parallel to this portion of the boundary. In other words, must be part of a heat flow line constant, and the isothermals constant intersect orthogonally.  We can solve this problem by finding a conformal mapping from onto the semi-infinite strip so that the image of the curve is the ray ; the image of the curve is the ray given by ; and the thermally insulated curve is mapped onto the thermally insulated segment of the axis, as shown in Figure .  The new problem in is to find the steady state temperature function so that along the rays, we have the boundary values .   Steady state temperatures with one boundary portion insulated    The condition that a segment of the boundary is insulated can be expressed mathematically by saying that the normal derivative of is zero. That is, , where is a coordinate measured perpendicular to the segment. We can easily verify that the function satisfies the conditions stated in Equations and for region . Therefore, using Equation , we find that the solution in is   The isothermals constant and their images under are also illustrated in Figure .

The mapping  conformally maps onto the semi-infinite strip , where the new problem is to find the steady state temperature that has the boundary conditions .

  "title": "Two-Dimensional Fluid Flow",
  "body": " Two-Dimensional Fluid Flow  Suppose that a fluid flows over the complex plane and that the velocity at the point is given by the velocity vector .  We also require that the velocity does not depend on time and the components and have continuous partial derivatives. The divergence of the vector field in Equation is given by and is a measure of the extent to which the velocity field diverges near the point. We consider only fluid flows for which the divergence is zero. This condition is more precisely characterized by the requirement that the net flow through any simply closed contour be identically zero.  If we consider the flow out of the small rectangle shown in Figure , then the rate of outward flow equals the line integral of the exterior normal component of taken over the sides of the rectangle. The exterior normal component is given by on the bottom edge, on the right edge, on the top edge, and on the left edge. Integrating and setting the resulting net flow to zero yields .   A two-dimensional vector field    Both and are continuously differentiable, so the mean value theorem implies that , where and . Substitution of the expressions displayed in Equation into Equation and subsequently dividing through by results in .  We can use the mean value theorem for integrals with this equation to show that , where and . Letting and in this equation yields , which is called the equation of continuity .  The curl of the vector field in Equation has magnitude and is an indication of how the field swirls in the vicinity of a point. Imagine that a fluid element at the point is suddenly frozen and then moves freely in the fluid. The fluid element will rotate with an angular velocity given by   We consider only fluid flows for which the curl is zero. Such fluid flows are called irrotational. This condition is more precisely characterized by requiring that the line integral of the tangential component of along any simply closed contour be identically zero. If we consider the rectangle in Figure , then the tangential component is given by on the bottom edge, on the right edge, on the top edge, and on the left edge. Integrating and equating the resulting circulation integral to zero yields .  As before, we apply the mean value theorem and divide through by , and obtain the equation .  We can use the mean value for integrals with this equation to deduce that . Letting and yields .  Equation and this equation show that the function satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and is an analytic function. If we let denote the antiderivative of , then , which is the complex potential of the flow and has the property   Since and , we also have , so is the velocity potential for the flow, and the curves are called equipotentials. The function is called the stream function. The curves are called streamlines and describe the paths of the fluid particles. To demonstrate this result, we implicitly differentiate and find that the slope of a vector tangent is given by . Using the fact that and this equation, we find that the tangent vector to the curve is   The salient idea of the preceding discussion is the conclusion that, if is an analytic function, then the family of curves represents the streamlines of a fluid flow.  The boundary condition for an ideal fluid flow is that should be parallel to the boundary curve containing the fluid (the fluid flows parallel to the walls of a containing vessel). In other words, if Equation is the complex potential for the flow, then the boundary curve must be given by for some constant ; that is, the boundary curve must be a streamline.   Invariance of flow   Let denote the complex potential for a fluid flow in a domain in the plane, where the velocity is . If the function is a one-to-one conformal mapping from a domain in the -plane onto , then the composite function is the complex potential for a fluid flow in , where the velocity is . The situation is shown in Figure .     The image of a fluid flow under a conformal mapping     From Equation , is an analytic function. Since the composition of analytic functions is analytic, is the required complex potential for an ideal fluid flow in .   We note that the functions are the new velocity potential and stream function, respectively, for the flow in . A streamline or natural boundary curve in the plane is mapped onto a streamline or natural boundary curve in the plane by the transformation . One method for finding a flow inside a domain in the plane is to conformally map onto a domain in the plane in which the flow is known.  For an ideal fluid with uniform density , the fluid pressure and speed are related by the following special case of Bernoulli's equation: . Note that the pressure is greatest when the speed is least.    The complex potential has the velocity potential and stream function of , respectively, and gives rise to the fluid flow defined in the entire complex plane that has a uniform parallel velocity of   The streamlines are parallel lines given by the equation constant and are inclined at an angle , as indicated in Figure .     A uniform parallel flow      Consider the complex potential , where is a positive real number. The velocity potential and stream function are given by , respectively. The streamlines form a family of hyperbolas with asymptotes along the coordinate axes. The velocity vector indicates that in the upper half-plane , the fluid flows down along the streamlines and spreads out along the axis, as against a wall, as depicted in Figure .     The fluid flow with complex potential      Find the complex potential for an ideal fluid flowing from left to right across the complex plane and around the unit circle .    We use the fact that the conformal mapping maps the domain one-to-one and onto the plane slit along the segment . The complex potential for a uniform horizontal flow parallel to this slit in the plane is , where is a positive real number. The stream function for the flow in the plane is so that the slit lies along the streamline .  The composite function determines the fluid flow in the domain , where the complex potential is , where . We can use polar coordinates to express as   The streamline consists of the rays along the axis and the curve , which is the unit circle . Thus the unit circle can be considered as a boundary curve for the fluid flow.  The approximation is valid for large values of , so we can approximate the flow with a uniform horizontal flow having speed at points that are distant from the origin. The streamlines and their images under the mapping are illustrated in Figure .     Fluid flow around a circle      Find the complex potential for an ideal fluid flowing from left to right across the complex plane and around the segment from to .    We use the conformal mapping where the branch of the square root of in each factor is , where , and  . The function given by is a one-to-one conformal mapping of the domain consisting of the plane slit along the segment . The complex potential for a uniform horizontal flow parallel to the slit in the plane is given by , where for convenience we choose and where the slit lies along the streamline . The composite function is the complex potential for a fluid flow in the domain . The streamlines given by for the flow in are obtained by finding the preimage of the streamline in given by the parametric equations . The corresponding streamline in is found by solving the equation for and in terms of . Squaring both sides of this equation yields . Equating the real and imaginary parts leads to the system of equations . Eliminating in the last two equations gives , and we can solve for in terms of to get for streamlines in .

He showed that the image of a circle passing through and containing the point is mapped onto a curve shaped like the cross section of an airplane wing. We call this curve the Joukowski airfoil . If the streamlines for a flow around the circle are known, then their images under the mapping will be streamlines for a flow around the Joukowski airfoil, as shown in Figure .   Image of a fluid flow under    The mapping is two-to-one, because , for . The region is mapped one-to-one onto the plane slit along the portion of the real axis . To visualize this mapping, we investigate the implicit form, which we obtain by using the substitutions .  Forming the quotient of these two quantities results in the relationship   The inverse of is . If we use the notation and , then we can express as the composition of , and : .  We can easily show that maps the four points , and onto , , , and , respectively. However, the composition functions in Equation must be considered in order to visualize the geometry involved. First, the bilinear transformation maps the region onto the right half-plane , and the points , and are mapped onto , and , respectively. Second, the function maps the right half plane onto the plane slit along its negative real axis, and the points , and , are mapped onto ,and , respectively. Then the bilinear transformation maps the latter region onto the plane slit along the portion of the real axis , and the points , and are mapped onto , and , respectively. These three compositions are shown in Figure .   The composition mappings for    The circle with center on the imaginary axis passes through the points and and has radius . With the restriction that , then this circle intersects the axis at the point with angle , with . We want to track the image of in the , and planes. First, the image of this circle under is the line that passes through the origin and is inclined at the angle . Second, the function maps the line onto the ray inclined at the angle . Finally, the transformation given by maps the ray onto the arc of the circle that passes through the points and and intersects the axis at with angle , where . The restriction on the angle , and hence , is necessary in order for the arc to have a low profile. The arc lies in the center of the Joukowski airfoil and is shown in Figure .   The images of the circles and under the mapping    If we let be fixed, , then the larger circle with center given by on the imaginary axis will pass through the points and and have radius . The circle also intersects the axis at the point at the angle . The image of circle under is the circle , which is tangent to at the origin. The function maps the circle onto the cardioid . Finally, maps the cardioid onto the Joukowski airfoil that passes through the point and surrounds the point , as shown in Figure . An observer traversing counterclockwise will traverse the image curves and clockwise but will traverse counterclockwise. Thus the points , and will always be to the observer's left.  Now we are ready to visualize the flow around the Joukowski airfoil. We start with the fluid flow around a circle (see Figure ). This flow is adjusted with a linear transformation so that it flows horizontally around the circle , as shown in Figure . Then the mapping creates a flow around the Joukowski airfoil, per Figure .

For the flow given by , where is a constant, we have . Setting in this equation, we get for all , so the unit circle is a natural boundary curve for the flow.  Points at which the flow has zero velocity are called stagnation points . To find them we solve : For the function in Equation we have . Multiplying through by and rearranging terms gives . Now we invoke the quadratic equation to obtain   If , then there are two stagnation points on the unit circle . If , then there is one stagnation point on the unit circle. If , then the stagnation point lies outside the unit circle. We are mostly interested in the case with two stagnation points. When , the two stagnation points are , which is the flow discussed in Example . The cases , and are shown in Figure .   Flows past the unit circle with circulation    We are now ready to combine the preceding ideas. For illustrative purposes, we consider a circle with center that passes through the points and and has radius . We use the linear transformation to map the flow with circulation (or ) around onto the flow around the circle , as shown in Figure .   Flow around     Flow around a Joukowski airfoil {0.5\\textwidth}   Then we use the mapping to map this flow around the Joukowski airfoil, as shown in Figure and compare it to the flows shown in Figures and . If the second transformation in the composition given by is modified to be , then the image of the flow shown in Figure will be the flow around the modified airfoil shown in Figure . The advantage of this latter airfoil is that the sides of its tailing edge form an angle of 0.15 radians, or , which is more realistic than the angle of of the traditional Joukowski airfoil.

  "body": " The Schwarz-Christoffel Transformation  To proceed further, we must review the rotational effect of a conformal mapping at a point . If the contour has the parameterization , then a vector tangent to at the point is . The image of is a contour given by , and a vector tangent to at the point is . If the angle of inclination of is , then the angle of inclination of is . Hence the angle of inclination of the tangent to at is rotated through the angle to obtain the angle of inclination of the tangent to at the point .  Many applications involving conformal mappings require the construction of a one-to-one conformal mapping from the upper half-plane onto a domain in the plane where the boundary consists of straight-line segments. Let's consider the case where is the interior of a polygon with vertices specified in the positive sense (counterclockwise). We want to find a function with the property .  Two German mathematicians Herman Amandus Schwarz (1843 1921) and Elwin Bruno Christoffel (1929 1900) independently discovered a method for finding , which we present as Theorem .   Schwarz-Christoffel   Let be a polygon in the plane with vertices and exterior angles , where . There exists a one-to-one conformal mapping from the upper half-plane onto that satisfies the boundary conditions in Equations . The derivative is , and the function can be expressed as an indefinite integral , where and are suitably chosen constants. Two of the points may be chosen arbitrarily, and the constants and determine the size and position of .     The proof relies on finding how much the tangent (which always points to the right) at the point must be rotated by the mapping so that the line segment is mapped onto the edge of that lies between the points and . The amount of rotation is determined by , so Equation specifies in terms of the values and the amount of rotation that is required at the vertex .   If we let and , then, for values of that lie in the interval , the amount of rotation is   Because for , and for , we can write this equation as   The angle of inclination of the tangent vector to the polygon at the point for is   The angle of inclination of the tangent vector to the polygon at the point , for , is   The angle of inclination of the vector tangent to the polygon jumps abruptly by the amount as the point moves along the side through the vertex to the side . Therefore the exterior angle to the polygon at the vertex is given by the angle and satisfies the inequality , for . Since the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon equals , we have and only angles need to be specified. The case is illustrated in Figure .

Note that these integrals do not represent elementary functions unless the image is an infinite region. Also, the integral will involve a multivalued function, and we must select a specific branch to fit the boundary values specified in the problem.

Use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula to verify that the function maps the upper half-plane onto the semi-infinite strip shown in Figure .

  "body": " Image of a Fluid Flow  We have already examined several two-dimensional fluid flows and have shown that the image of a flow under a conformal transformation is a flow. The conformal mapping , which we obtained by using the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, allows us to find the streamlines for flows in domains in the plane that are bounded by straight-line segments.  The first technique involves finding the image of a fluid flowing horizontally from left to right across the upper half-plane . The image of the streamline is a streamline given by the parametric equations and is oriented in the positive sense (counterclockwise). The streamline is considered to be a boundary wall for a containing vessel for the fluid flow.    Consider the conformal mapping , which we obtained by using the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. It maps the upper half-plane onto the domain in the plane that lies above the boundary curve consisting of the rays and and the segment . Furthermore, the image of horizontal streamlines in the plane are curves in the plane given by the parametric equation , for . The new flow is that of a step in the bed of a deep stream and is illustrated in Figure (a). The function is also defined for values of in the lower half-plane, and the images of horizontal streamlines that lie above or below the axis are mapped onto streamlines that flow past a long rectangular obstacle, which is illustrated in Figure (b).

  "title": "Sources and Sinks",
  "body": " Sources and Sinks   If the two-dimensional motion of an ideal fluid consists of an outward radial flow from a point and is symmetrical in all directions, then the point is called a simple source . A source at the origin can be considered as a line perpendicular to the plane along which fluid is being emitted. If the rate of emission of volume of fluid per unit length is 2 , then the origin is said to be a source of strength , the complex potential for the flow is , and the velocity at the point is given by . For fluid flows, a sink is a negative source and is a point of inward radial flow at which the fluid is considered to be absorbed or annihilated. Figure illustrates these concepts.   Sources and sinks for an ideal fluid      Source: A Charged Line  In the case of electrostatics, a source will correspond to a uniformly charged line perpendicular to the plane at the point . We will show that if the line is located at and carries a charge density of coulombs per unit length, then the magnitude of the electrical field is . Hence, is given by , and the complex potential is .  A sink for electrostatics is a negatively charged line perpendicular to the plane. The electric field for electrostatic problems corresponds to the velocity field for fluid flow problems, except that their corresponding potentials differ by a sign change.  To establish Equation , we start with Coulomb's law, which states that two particles with charges and exert a force on one another with magnitude , where is the distance between particles and is a constant that depends on the scientific units. For simplicity, we assume that and the test particle at the point has charge .  The contribution induced by the element of charge along the segment of length situated at a height above the plane has magnitude given by . It has the same magnitude as induced by the element located a distance below the plane. From the vertical symmetry involved their sum, , lies parallel to the plane along the ray from the origin, as shown in Figure .   Contributions to from the elements of charge situated at , above and below the -plane.    By the principal of superposition, we add all contributions from the elements of charge along to obtain . By vertical symmetry, lies parallel to the complex plane along the ray from the origin through the point . Hence the magnitude of is the sum of all components that are parallel to the complex plane, where is the angle between and the plane. Letting in this summation process produces the definite integral .  Next, we use the change of variable and and the trigonometric identity to obtain the equivalent integral: .  Multiplying this magnitude by the unit vector establishes Formula . If , then the field is directed away from and, if , then it is directed toward . An electrical field located at is given by , and the corresponding complex potential is    Source and sink of equal strength   Let a source and sink of unit strength be located at the points and , respectively. The complex potential for a fluid flowing from the source at to the sink at is . The velocity potential and stream function are, respectively . To solve for the streamline we start with , and obtain the equation . A straightforward calculation shows that points on the streamline must satisfy the equation , which is the equation of a circle with center at that passes through the points . Several streamlines are indicated in Figure (a).     Fields depicting electrical strength     Two sources of equal strength   Let two sources of unit strength be located at the points . The resulting complex potential for a fluid flow is . The velocity potential and stream function are, respectively , To solve for the streamline we start with , and obtain the equation . If we express this equation in the form , and use the rotation of axes , then the streamlines must satisfy the equation and are rectangular hyperbolas with centers at the origin that pass through the points . Figure (b) depicts several streamlines.    Let an ideal fluid flow in a domain in the plane be effected by a source located at the point . Then the flow at points , which lie in a small neighborhood of the point , is approximated by that of a source with the complex potential   If is a conformal mapping and , then has a nonzero derivative at , and , where as . Taking logarithms yields . Because , the term approaches the constant value as . Also, because is the complex potential for a source located at the point , the image of a source under a conformal mapping is a source.  We can use the technique of conformal mapping to determine the fluid flow in a domain in the plane that is produced by sources and sinks. If we can construct a conformal mapping so that the image of sources, sinks, and boundary curves for the flow in are mapped onto sources, sinks, and boundary curves in a domain where the complex potential is known to be , then the complex potential in is given by .    Suppose that the lines are considered as walls of a containing vessel for a fluid flow produced by a single source of unit strength located at the origin. The conformal mapping maps the infinite strip bounded by the lines onto the plane slit along the boundary rays and , and the image of the source at is a source located at . The complex potential determines a fluid flow in the plane past the boundary curves and , which lie along streamlines of the flow. Therefore the complex potential for the fluid flow in the infinite strip in the plane is   Several streamlines for the flow are illustrated in Figure .     A source in the center of a strip      Suppose that the lines are considered as walls of a containing vessel for the fluid flow produced by a single source of unit strength located at the point and a sink of unit strength located at the point .

The image of the source at is a source at , and the image of the sink at is a sink at . The potential determines a fluid flow in the plane past the boundary curves and , which lie along streamlines of the flow. Therefore the complex potential for the fluid flow in the infinite strip in the plane is   Several streamlines for the flow are illustrated in Figure .     A source and a sink on the edges of a strip    We can use the technique of transformation of a source to determine the effluence from a channel extending from infinity. In this case, we construct a conformal mapping from the upper half-plane so that the single source located at is mapped to the point at infinity that lies along the channel. The streamlines emanating from in the upper half-plane are mapped onto streamlines issuing from the channel.    Consider the conformal mapping , which maps the upper half-plane onto the domain consisting of the upper half-plane joined to the channel . The point is mapped onto the point along the channel. Images of the rays , are streamlines issuing from the channel as indicated in Figure .

  "title": "Fourier Series",
  "body": " Fourier Series   In this chapter we show how Fourier series, the Fourier transform, and the Laplace transform are related to the study of complex analysis. We develop the Fourier series representation of a real-valued function of the real variable . Complex Fourier series and Fourier transforms are then discussed. Finally, we develop the Laplace transform and the complex variable technique for finding its inverse. This chapter focuses on applying these ideas to solving problems involving real-valued functions, so many of the theorems throughout are stated without proof.  Let be a real-valued function that is periodic with period , that is, . One such function is , and its graph is obtained by repeating the portion of the graph in any interval of length , as shown in Figure .   A function with period    Familiar examples of real functions that have period are and , where is an integer. This raises the question whether any periodic function can be represented by a sum of terms involving and , where and are real constants. As we shall soon see, the answer to this question is often yes.   Piecewise Continuous   The function is piecewise continuous on the closed interval if there exists values with such that is continuous in each of the open intervals and has left- and right-hand limits at the values for .    We use the symbols and for the left- and right-hand limits, respectively, of a function as approaches the point . The graph of a piecewise continuous function is illustrated in Figure .    A piecewise continuous function over the interval    The left- and right-hand limits at , , and are easy to determine:    Fourier Series   If is periodic with period and is piecewise continuous on then the Fourier series for is , where the coefficients and are given by the so-called Euler's Formulas: and     The factor in the constant term on the right side of Equation has been introduced for convenience so that could be obtained from the general formula in Equation by setting . The reasons for this will be explained shortly. The next result discusses convergence of the Fourier series.   Fourier Expansion   Assume that is the Fourier series for . If is piecewise continuous on , then is convergent for all where is continuous. If is a point of discontinuity of , then , where and denote the left- and right-hand limits, respectively. With this understanding, we have the Fourier expansion: .      Show that the function for , extended periodically by the equation , has the Fourier series expansion     Using Euler's Formulas and integration by parts, we obtain , and then using Formula we get .  The coefficient is computed by the calculation .  Substituting the coefficients and in Equation produces the required solution. The graphs of and the first three partial sums , and are shown in Figure .     , and approximations , and    We now state some general properties of Fourier series that are useful for calculating the coefficients. The proofs are left for the reader.    If and have Fourier series representations, then their sum has a Fourier series representation, and the Fourier coefficients of are obtained by adding the corresponding coefficients of and .     Fourier Cosine Series   Assume that is an even function. If has period , and and are piecewise continuous, then the Fourier series for involves only the cosine terms, i.e. , for all : , where ,     Fourier Sine Series   Assume that is an odd function. If has period and if and are piecewise continuous, then the Fourier series for involves only sine terms, i.e. , for all : , where ,     Termwise Integration   If has a Fourier series representation given in Equation , then the integral of has a Fourier series representation which can be obtained by termwise integration of the Fourier Series of , that is, , where we have used the expansion from Example .     Termwise Differentiation   If has a Fourier series representation, and is given by Equation , then        Show that the function for , extended periodically the equation , has the Fourier series representation     The function is an even function, hence we can use Theorem to conclude that for all , and .  The coefficient is computed by the calculation: . Using the and Theorem produces the required solution.      Proof of Euler's Formulas  The following intuitive proof will justify the Euler formulas given in Equations and To determine we integrate both and the Fourier series representation in Equation from to , which results in . Next, we perform integration term by term, and we obtain . The value of the first integral on the right side of this equation is and all the other integrals are zero. Hence we obtain the desired formula for : . To determine , we let denote a fixed integer and multiply both and the Fourier series representation in Equation by the term , and then we integrate and obtain .  The value of the first term on the right side of Equation is easily seen to be zero: .  The value of the term involving is found by using the trigonometric identity: . Calculation reveals that if (and ), then .  When , the value of the integral becomes: .  The value of the term on the right side of Equation involving the integrand is found by using the trigonometric identity , and for all values of and , we obtain .  Therefore, we can use the results of Equations in Equation to obtain , and Equation is established. We leave it as an exercise to establish Euler's Formula for the coefficients . A complete discussion of the details of the proof of Theorem can be found in some advanced texts. See for instance, John W.

The Dirichlet problem for the unit disk .     Dirichet Solution   If has period , and has the Fourier series representation , then the solution to the Dirichlet problem in is , where denotes a complex number in the closed disk .    We will prove this theorem shortly, but note meanwhile that it is easy to see that the series representation in Equation for takes on the boundary values given in Equation at points on the unit circle . Since each term and in series given in Equation is harmonic, it is reasonable to conclude that the infinite series representing will also be harmonic.  Before proving Theorem we establish a result that gives an integral representation for a function that is harmonic in a domain containing the closed unit disk. The result is the analog to Poisson's integral formula for the upper half plane.   Poisson Integral Formula for the Unit Disk   Let be a function that is harmonic in a simply connected domain that contains the closed unit disk . If takes on the boundary values , then has the integral representation that is valid for .     Since is harmonic in the simply connected domain, there exists a conjugate harmonic function such that is analytic. Let denote the contour consisting of the unit circle; then Cauchy 's integral formula expresses the value of at any point inside in terms of the values of at points that lie on the circle . If we set then lies outside the unit circle and the Cauchy-Goursat theorem gives .  If we subtract Equation from Equation , then use the parameterization , and the substitutions , , we get .  The expression inside the parentheses on the right side of this equation can be written as , and it follows that .  Since is the real part of and is the real part of , we can equate the real parts in the latter equation to obtain Equation , completing the proof Theorem .   We now turn our attention to the proof Theorem .   The real-valued function is known as the Poisson kernel. Expanding the left side of Equation in a geometric series gives .

  "title": "Vibrations in Mechanical Systems",
  "body": " Vibrations in Mechanical Systems   Consider a spring that resists compression as well as extension, that is suspended vertically from a fixed support, and a body of mass that is attached at the lower end of the spring. We make the assumption that the mass is much larger than the mass of the spring so that we can neglect the mass of the spring. If there is no motion then the system is in static equilibrium, as illustrated in Figure . If the mass is pulled down further and released, then it will undergo an oscillatory motion.   The spring mass system    Suppose there is no friction to slow down the motion of the mass, then we say that the system is undamped . We will determine the motion of this mechanical system by considering the forces acting on the mass during the motion. This will lead to a differential equation relating the displacement as a function of time. The most obvious force is that of gravitational attraction acting on the mass and is given by , where is the acceleration of gravity. The next force to be considered is the spring force acting on the mass and is directed upward if the spring is stretched and downward if it is compressed. It obeys Hooke's law , where is the amount the spring is stretched when and is the amount it is compressed when .  When the system is in static equilibrium and the spring is stretched by the amount , the resultant of the spring force and the gravitational force is zero, which is expressed by the equation .  Let denote the displacement from static equilibrium with the positive direction pointed downward as indicated in Figure 10.17(b).The spring force can be written as , and the resultant force is .  The differential equation for motion is obtained by using Newton's second law, which states that the resultant of the forces acting on the mass at any instant satisfies .  The distance from equilibrium at time is measured by , so the acceleration is given by . Equations and then give   Therefore, the undamped mechanical system is governed by the linear differential equation .  The general solution to undamped system is known to be     Damped System  If we consider frictional forces that slow down the motion of the mass, then we say that the system is damped. This is visualized by connecting a dashpot to the mass, as indicated in Figure . For small velocities it is assumed that the frictional force is proportional to the velocity, that is,    The spring mass dashpot system    The damping constant must be positive, for if , then the mass is moving downward and hence must point upward, which requires that is negative. The result of the three forces acting on the mass is given by , so the damped mechanical system is governed by the differential equation .    Forced Vibrations  The vibration discussed earlier are called free vibrations because all the forces that affect the motion of the system are internal to the system. We extend our analysis to cover the case in which an external force acts on the mass (see Figure ). Such a force might occur from vibrations of the support to which the top of the spring is attached, or from the effect of a magnetic field on a mass made of iron. As before, we sum the forces , , , and and set this equal to the resultant force and obtain    The dashpot system with an external force    Thus, the forced motion of the mechanical system satisfies the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation .  The function is called the input or driving force and the solution is called the output or response . Of particular interest are periodic inputs that can be represented by Fourier series.  For damped mechanical systems that are driven by a periodic input , the general solution involves a transient part that vanishes as , and a steady state part that is periodic. The transient part of the solution is found by solving the homogeneous differential equation .  This homogeneous equation has the characteristic equation , and it's roots are . The coefficients , , and are all positive, and there are three cases to consider.   If , the roots are real and distinct, and since , it follows that the roots and are negative real numbers. Thus, for this case, we have .    If ,the roots are real and equal, then , where is a negative real number. Again, for this case we find that .    If , the roots are complex, then , where and are positive real numbers, and it follows that .   In all three cases, we see that the homogeneous solution decays to as . The steady state solution can be obtained by representing by its Fourier series and substituting , , and into the nonhomogeneous differential equation and solving the resulting system for the Fourier coefficients of . The general solution to Equation is then given by     Find the general solution to , where is given by the Fourier series .    First we solve for the transient solution. The characteristic equation is , which has a double root . Hence . The steady state solution is obtained by assuming that has the Fourier series representation , and that and can be obtained by termwise differentiation: .  Substituting these expansions into the differential equation results in .    Equating the coefficients with the given series for , we find that , and that .  Solving this linear system for and , we find that   The general solution is given by .

Many practical problems involve nonperiodic functions. A representation analogous to Fourier series for a nonperiodic function is obtained by considering the Fourier series of for and then taking the limit as . The result is known as the Fourier transform of .  Start with a nonperiodic function and consider the periodic function with period , where .  Then has the complex Fourier series representation .  We introduce some terminology to discuss the terms in Equation , first   If denotes time, then the units for are radians per unit time. The set of all possible frequencies is called the frequency spectrum, i.e. , .  It is important to note that as increases, the spectrum becomes finer and approaches a continuous spectrum of frequencies.

  "title": "The Laplace Transform",
  "body": " The Laplace Transform   From Fourier Transforms to Laplace Transforms  We have seen that certain real-valued functions have a Fourier transform and that the integral defines the complex function of the real variable . If we multiply the integrand by , we create a complex function of the complex variable : .  The function is called the two-sided Laplace transform of , and it exists when the Fourier transform of the function exists. From the Fourier transform theory, we can state that a sufficient condition for to exist is that exists. For a given function , this integral is finite for values of that lie in some interval .  The two-sided Laplace transform uses the lower limit of integration, that is, , and hence requires a knowledge of the past history of the function , i.e. , . For most physical applications, one is interested in the behavior of a system only for . Mathematically speaking, the initial conditions , are a consequence of the past history of the system and are often all that is necessary to know. For this reason, it is useful to define the one-sided Laplace transform of , which is commonly referred to simply as the Laplace transform of , which is also defined as an integral: .  If the defining integral for the Laplace transform exists for , then values of with imply that , and thus , and it follows that exists for . Therefore, the Laplace transform is defined for all points in the right half-plane .  Another way to view the relationship between the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform is to consider the function given by   Then the Fourier transform theory shows us that , and since the integrand is zero for , this equation can be written as . Use the change of variable and , where is held fixed, then the new limits of integration are from to . The resulting equation is . Therefore, the Laplace transform is , and the inverse Laplace transform is .    Properties of the Laplace Transform  Although a function may be defined for all values of , its Laplace transform is not influenced by values of , where . The Laplace transform of is actually defined for the function given by   A sufficient condition for the existence of the Laplace transform is that does not grow too rapidly as . We say that the function is of exponential order if there exists real constants and , such that .  All functions in this chapter are assumed to be of exponential order. The next theorem shows that their Laplace transform exists for values of in a domain that includes the right half-plane .   Existence of the Laplace Transform   If is of exponential order, then its Laplace transform is given by . The defining integral for exists at points in the right half plane .     Using we see that can be expressed as . Then for values of , we have , which imply that the integrals defining the real and imaginary parts of exist for values of .    Note : The domain of definition of the defining integral for the Laplace transform seems to be restricted to a half plane. However, the resulting formula might have a domain much larger than this half plane. Later we will show that is an analytic function of the complex variable . For most applications involving Laplace transforms that we will study, the Laplace transforms are rational functions that have the form , where and are polynomials, and some other important ones will have the form .   Linearity of the Laplace Transform   Let and have Laplace transforms and , respectively. If and are constants, then      Let be chosen so that both and are defined for , then .    Uniqueness of the Laplace Transform   Let and have Laplace transforms and , respectively. If , then .     If is sufficiently large, then the integral representation, Equation , for the inverse Laplace transform can be used to obtain .     Show that the Laplace transform of the step function given by .    Using the integral definition for , we obtain .      Show that , where is a real constant.    We will actually show that the integral defining is equal to the formula for values of with , and the extension to other values of is inferred by our knowledge about the domain of a rational function. Using straightforward integration techniques we find that .  Let be held fixed, or where . Then since is a negative real number we have and this result can be used in the latter equation to obtain the desired conclusion.    The property of linearity can be used to find new Laplace transforms from known ones.    Show that .    Since , we obtain .    The technique of integration by parts is also helpful in finding new Laplace transforms.    Show that .    Using integration by parts we obtain .  For values of in the right half plane , an argument similar to that in Example shows that the last limit approaches zero. This observation establishes the result.      Show that .    A direct approach using the definition is tedious. Let us assume that the complex constants are permitted and hence following the Laplace transforms exist: . Using the linearity of the Laplace transform we obtain .    Inverting the Laplace transform is usually accomplished with the aid of a table of known Laplace transforms and the technique of partial fraction expansion.    Find .

Now we can use the first result to establish the second one:     One of the main uses of the Laplace transform is its role in the solution of differential equations. The utility of the Laplace transform lies in the fact that the transform of the derivative corresponds to multiplication of the transform by and then the subtraction of . This permits us to replace the calculus operation of differentiation with simple algebraic operations on transforms.  This idea is used to develop a method for solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients. Consider the initial value problem with initial conditions and .
