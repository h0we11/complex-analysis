<div class="para">In this section we investigate some basic ideas concerning sets of points in the plane. The first concept is that of a curve. Intuitively, we think of a curve as a piece of string placed on a flat surface in some type of meandering pattern. More formally, we define a curve to be the range of a continuous complex-valued function <span class="process-math">\(z(t)\)</span> defined on the interval <span class="process-math">\([a, b]\text{.}\)</span> That is, a curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the range of a function given by <span class="process-math">\(z(t) = \big(x(t),
y(t)\big) = x(t) +iy(t)\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a \le t \le b\text{,}\)</span> where both <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> are continuous real-valued functions. If both <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> are differentiable, we say that the curve is smooth. A curve for which <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> are differentiable except for a finite number of points is called <em class="emphasis">piecewise smooth</em>. We specify a curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
C:z(t) =x(t) +iy(t) =\big(x(t), y(t)\big)  \text{ for }   a \le t \le b\text{,}\tag{1.6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">and say that <span class="process-math">\(z(t)\)</span> is a parametrization for the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Note that, with this parametrization, we are specifying a direction for the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> saying that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a curve that goes from the initial point <span class="process-math">\(z(a) =(x(a),
y(a)) = x(a)+iy(a)\)</span> to the terminal point <span class="process-math">\(z(b) = \big(x(b),
y(b)\big) = x(b)+iy(b)\text{.}\)</span> If we had another function whose range was the same set of points as <span class="process-math">\(z(t)\)</span> but whose initial and final points were reversed, we would indicate the curve that this function defines by <span class="process-math">\(-C\text{.}\)</span>
