<div class="para">After six editions of publishing with Jones and Bartlett Learning we are delighted that we can now make this text available as an open-source document, and have designed it for students in mathematics, physics, and engineering at the undergraduate level. Our goal is to illustrate the theoretical concepts and proofs with practical applications, and to present them in a style that is enjoyable for students to read. We believe both mathematicians and scientists should be exposed to a careful presentation of mathematics. Our use of the term “careful” here means paying attention to such things as ensuring required assumptions are met before using a theorem, checking that algebraic operations are valid, and confirming that formulas have not been blindly applied. We do not mean to equate care with rigor, as we present our proofs in a self-contained manner that is understandable by students having studied multivariable calculus. For example, we include Green’s theorem and use it to prove the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, although we also include the proof by Goursat. Depending on the level of rigor desired, students may look at one or the other—or both.</div>
