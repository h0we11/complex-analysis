<div class="para">Note further that, at <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> the curve has crossed over itself (at points other than those corresponding with <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t=2\pi\)</span>); we want to be able to distinguish when a curve does not cross over itself in this way. The curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is called simple if it does not cross over itself, except possibly at its initial and terminal points. In other words, the curve <span class="process-math">\(C:z(t)\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a \le t \le b\text{,}\)</span> is simple provided that <span class="process-math">\(z(t_1) \ne z(t_2)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(t_1 \ne t_2\text{,}\)</span> except possibly when <span class="process-math">\(t_1=a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t_2=b\text{.}\)</span>
