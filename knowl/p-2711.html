<div class="para">The point <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is called an isolated singularity of a complex function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not analytic at <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> but there exists a real number <span class="process-math">\(R&gt;0\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is analytic everywhere in the punctured disk <span class="process-math">\(D_{R}^{\ast }(\alpha)\text{.}\)</span> The function <span class="process-math">\(f(z) =\frac{1 }{1-z}\)</span> has an isolated singularity at <span class="process-math">\(\alpha =1\text{.}\)</span> The function <span class="process-math">\(g(z) =\)</span> Log <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> however, has a singularity at <span class="process-math">\(\alpha =0\)</span> (or at any point of the negative real axis) that is not isolated, because any neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> contains points on the negative real axis, and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is not analytic at those points. Functions with isolated singularities have a Laurent series because the punctured disk <span class="process-math">\(D_{R}^{\ast }(\alpha)\)</span> is the same as the annulus <span class="process-math">\(A(\alpha ,0,R)\text{.}\)</span> We now look at this special case of Laurentâ€™s theorem in order to classify three types of isolated singularities.</div>
