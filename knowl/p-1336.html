<div class="para">The points in the blue, red, and green regions are those “initial guesses” that will converge to the roots <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2} +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\text{,}\)</span> respectively. (The roots themselves are located in the middle of the three largest colored regions.) The complexity of this picture becomes apparent when you observe that, wherever two colors appear to meet, the third color emerges between them. But then, a closer inspection of the area where this third color meets one of the other colors reveals again a different color between them. This process continues with an infinite complexity.</div>
