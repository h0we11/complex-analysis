<div class="para">We seldom are interested in studying functions that arenâ€™t differentiable, or are differentiable at only a single point. Complex functions that have a derivative at all points in a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> deserve further study. Indeed, functions that are differentiable in neighborhoods of points are pillars of the complex analysis edifice. We give them a special name, as indicated in the following definition.</div>
