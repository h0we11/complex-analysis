<div class="para">It is important to stress that the line integral of an analytic function is independent of path. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Int_z_two_ways.html" title="Example 6.2.14">Example 6.2.14</a> we showed that <span class="process-math">\(\int_{C_1}z\ dz=\int_{C_2}z\ dz=4+2i\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> were different contours joining <span class="process-math">\(-1-i\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(3+i\text{.}\)</span> Because the integrand <span class="process-math">\(f(z)=z\)</span> is an analytic function, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Antideriv_Thm.html" title="Theorem 6.4.1: Indefinite integrals, or antiderivatives">Theorem 6.4.1</a> lets us know ahead of time that the value of the two integrals is the same; hence one calculation would have sufficed. If you ever have to compute a line integral of an analytic function over a difficult contour, change the contour to something easier. You are guaranteed to get the same answer. Of course, you must be sure that the function you’re dealing with is analytic in a simply connected domain containing your original and new contours.</div>
