<div class="para">We can obtain the antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1+3\cos^2t}\)</span> by using software such as Mathematica or MAPLE. It is <span class="process-math">\(\int \frac{1}{1+3\cos^2t}\,dt = \frac{-\mathrm{Arctan}(2\cot t)}{2} = g(t)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\cot 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cot 2\pi\)</span> are not defined, the computations for both <span class="process-math">\(g(0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(2\pi)\)</span> are indeterminate. The graph <span class="process-math">\(s=g(t)\)</span> shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-08-03.html" title="Figure 8.2.4">FigureÂ 8.2.4</a> reveals another problem: The integrand <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1+3\cos^2t}\)</span> is a continuous function for all <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> but the function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a discontinuity at <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> This condition appears to be a violation of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which asserts that the integral of a continuous function must be differentiable and hence continuous. The problem is that <span class="process-math">\(g(t)\)</span> is not an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1+3\cos^2t}\)</span> for <em class="emphasis">all</em> <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2\pi ]\text{.}\)</span> Oddly, it is the antiderivative at all points <em class="emphasis">except</em> <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\pi\text{,}\)</span> which you can verify by computing <span class="process-math">\(g\,'(t)\)</span> and showing that it equals <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1+3\cos^2t}\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(g(t)\)</span> is defined.</div>
