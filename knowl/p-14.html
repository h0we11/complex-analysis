<div class="para">If Cardano could get any value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that solved a depressed cubic, he could easily get a corresponding solution to Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Cubic_Equation.html" title="Equation 1.1.1">(1.1.1)</a> from the identity <span class="process-math">\(z=x-\frac{a_2}{3}\text{.}\)</span> Happily, Cardano knew how to solve a depressed cubic. The technique had been communicated to him by Niccolo Fontana who, unfortunately, came to be known as Tartaglia (the <em class="emphasis">stammerer</em>) due to a speaking disorder that was caused when he was 12 years old. (Evidently, during the Italian wars, French troops sacked his home in Brescia, Italy in 1512, and struck Tartaglia in the face with a saber.) In any case, the procedure was also independently discovered some 30 years earlier by Scipione del Ferro of Bologna. Ferro and Tartaglia showed that one of the solutions to Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/DC_Equation.html" title="Equation 1.1.2">(1.1.2)</a> is</div>
