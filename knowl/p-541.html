<div class="para">The last chapter developed a basic theory of complex numbers. For the next few chapters we turn our attention to <em class="emphasis">functions</em> of complex numbers. They are defined in a similar way to functions of real numbers that you studied in calculus; the only difference is that they operate on complex numbers rather than real numbers. This chapter focuses primarily on very basic functions, their representations, and properties associated with functions such as limits and continuity. You will learn some interesting applications as well as some exciting new ideas.</div>
