<div class="para">Complex analysis can roughly be thought of as the subject that applies the theory of calculus to imaginary numbers. But what exactly are imaginary numbers? Usually, students learn about them in high school with introductory remarks from their teachers along the following lines: “We can’t take the square root of a negative number. But let’s <em class="emphasis">pretend</em> we can and begin by using the symbol <span class="process-math">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\)</span> .” Rules are then learned for doing arithmetic with these numbers. At some level the rules make sense: if <span class="process-math">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> it stands to reason that <span class="process-math">\(i^2=-1\text{.}\)</span> However, it is not uncommon for students to wonder whether they are really doing magic rather than mathematics.</div>
