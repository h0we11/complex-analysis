<div class="para">Note that this algorithm doesn’t prove anything. In Step 2, there is no a priori reason to justify the assumption mentioned, nor is there any necessity for an initial point <span class="process-math">\(z_{ij}\)</span> to have its sequence of iterates converging to one of the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f(z) =0\)</span> just because a particular iteration is within <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> of that root. Finally, the fact that one point in a rectangle behaves in a certain way does not imply that all the points in that rectangle behave in a like manner. Nevertheless, we can use this algorithm as a basis for mathematical explorations. Indeed, computer experiments such as the one described have contributed to a lot of exciting mathematics during the past 30 years. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_ch-04-cp-1.html" title="Figure 4.2.5">Figure 4.2.5</a> shows the results for the cubic polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(z)=z^3+1\text{.}\)</span>
