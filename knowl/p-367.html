<div class="para">The real numbers are deficient in the sense that not all algebraic operations on them produce real numbers. Thus, for <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> to make sense, we must consider the domain of complex numbers. Do complex numbers have this same deficiency? That is, if we are to make sense of expressions such as <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{1+i}\text{,}\)</span> must we appeal to yet another new number system? The answer to this question is <em class="emphasis">no.</em> In other words, any reasonable algebraic operation performed on complex numbers gives complex numbers. Later we show how to evaluate intriguing expressions such as <span class="process-math">\(i^{i}\text{.}\)</span> For now we only look at integral powers and roots of complex numbers.</div>
