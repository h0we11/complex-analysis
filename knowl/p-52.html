<div class="para">As time passed, mathematicians gradually refined their thinking, and by the end of the nineteenth century complex numbers were firmly entrenched. Thus, as it is with many new mathematical or scientific innovations, the theory of complex numbers evolved by way of a very intricate process. But what is the theory that Tartaglia, Ferro, Cardano, Bombelli, Wallis, Euler, Cauchy, Gauss, and so many others helped produce? That is, how do we now think of complex numbers? We explore this question in the remainder of this chapter.</div>
