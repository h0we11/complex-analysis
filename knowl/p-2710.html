<div class="para">Recall that the point <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is called a singular point, or singularity, of the complex function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not analytic at the point <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{,}\)</span> but every neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(D_{R}(\alpha)\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> contains at least one point at which <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is analytic. For example, the function <span class="process-math">\(f(z) =\frac{1}{1-z}\)</span> is not analytic at <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=1\)</span> but is analytic for all other values of <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> Thus the point <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=1\)</span> is a singular point of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> As another example, consider the function <span class="process-math">\(g(z) =\)</span> Log <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> We showed in Section 5.2 that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is analytic for all <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> except at the origin and at the points on the negative real axis. Thus the origin and each point on the negative real axis are singularities of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span>
