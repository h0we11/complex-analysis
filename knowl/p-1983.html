<div class="para">Of the two main topics studied in calculus–differentiation and integration–we have so far only studied derivatives of complex functions. We now turn to the problem of integrating complex functions. The theory you will learn is elegant, powerful, and a useful tool for physicists and engineers. It also connects widely with other branches of mathematics. For example, even though the ideas presented here belong to the general area of mathematics known as analysis, you will see as an application of them one of the simplest proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra.</div>
