<div class="para">The physical problems we just mentioned are real-world applications and involve solutions in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Such problems generally would involve the Laplacian in three variables and the divergence and curl of three-dimensional vector functions. Since complex analysis involves only <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> we consider the special case in which the solution does not vary with the coordinate along the axis perpendicular to the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane. For steady state heat flow and electrostatics, this assumption means that the temperature, <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> or the potential, <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> varies only with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Thus for the flow of ideal fluids, the fluid motion is the same in any plane that is parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> plane. Curves drawn in the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> plane are to be interpreted as cross sections that correspond to infinite cylinders perpendicular to the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> plane. An infinite cylinder is the limiting case of a “long” physical cylinder, so the mathematical model that we present is valid provided the three-dimensional problem involves a physical cylinder long enough that the effects at the ends can be reasonably neglected.</div>
