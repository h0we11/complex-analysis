<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">A.L. Cauchy (1789–1857) played a prominent role in the development of complex analysis, and his name appears often throughout this text. The last name is <em class="emphasis">not</em> pronounced as “kaushee.” The first syllable has a long “o” sound, like the word kosher, but with the second syllable having a long “e” instead of “er” at the end. Thus, we pronounce Cauchy as “kōsh\={e}.” In mathematical circles it is not kosher to mispronounce Cauchy!</div></body>
