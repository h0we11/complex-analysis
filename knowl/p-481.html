<div class="para">A domain, together with some, none, or all its boundary points, is called a region. For example, the horizontal strip <span class="process-math">\(\{z:1\lt \mathrm{Im}(z) \le 2\}\)</span> is a region. A set formed by taking the union of a domain and its boundary is called a closed region; thus <span class="process-math">\(\{z:1 \le \mathrm{Im}(z) \le 2\}\)</span> is a closed region. A set is said to be a bounded set if it can be completely contained in some closed disk, that is, if there exists an <span class="process-math">\(R&gt;0\)</span> such that for each <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(|z| \le R\text{.}\)</span> The rectangle given by <span class="process-math">\(\{z:|x| \le 4 \text{ and } |y| \le 3\}\)</span> is bounded because it is contained inside the disk <span class="process-math">\(\overline{D}_5(0)\text{.}\)</span> A set that cannot be enclosed by any closed disk is called an unbounded set.</div>
