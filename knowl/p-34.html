<div class="para">Although Wallis only hinted at such a conclusion, he nevertheless helped set the stage for thinking of real numbers as being embedded in a larger set of complex numbers, and that these numbers could be represented as “points in the plane.” Unfortunately, if we tried to apply Wallis’ method to construct complex numbers we would find it had some serious defects. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(b=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c=1\)</span> the expression <span class="process-math">\(\pm \sqrt{b^2-c^2}\)</span> becomes <span class="process-math">\(\pm \sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> and points <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> now coincide at point <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> But we surely would not want to say that <span class="process-math">\(-\sqrt{-1}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(+\sqrt{-1}\)</span> are the same number. Thus, even with Wallis’ work the jigsaw of getting a legitimate picture of complex numbers remained. It would be yet another century before someone put most of the pieces together.</div>
