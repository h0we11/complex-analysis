<div class="para">For convenience, at times we use the term <em class="emphasis">sequence</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">complex sequence.</em> If we want a function <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> to represent an arbitrary sequence, we can specify it by writing <span class="process-math">\(s(1)=z_1, \, s(3)=z_3\text{,}\)</span> and so on. The values <span class="process-math">\(z_1, \, z_2, \, z_3, \ldots\text{,}\)</span> are called the terms of a sequence, and mathematicians, being generally lazy when it comes to such things, often refer to <span class="process-math">\(z_1, \, z_2, \, z_3 \ldots\)</span> as the sequence itself, even though they are really speaking of the range of the sequence when they do so. You will usually see a sequence written as <span class="process-math">\(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \; \{z_n\}_1^{\infty}\text{,}\)</span> or, when the indices are understood, as <span class="process-math">\(\{z_n\}\text{.}\)</span> Mathematicians are also not so fussy about starting a sequence at <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\{z_n\} _{n=-1}^{\infty}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{z_k\} _{k=0}^{\infty}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> would also be acceptable notation provided all terms were defined. For example, the sequence <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> given by Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Seq_Ex_4.html" title="Equation 4.1.4">(4.1.4)</a> could be written in a variety of ways:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/Seq_Ex_4.html">
\begin{align*}
\amp \amp  \left\{\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{i}{2}\right)^{\!n}\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \left\{\left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2}\right)^{\!n}\right\}_1^{\infty}, \left\{\left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{i}{2}\right)^{\!n}\right\},\\
\amp \amp  \left\{\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{i}{2}\right)^{\!n+3}\right\}_{n=-2}^{\infty}, \left\{\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{i}{2}\right)^{\!k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty},\ \ldots
