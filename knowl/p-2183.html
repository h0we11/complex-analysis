<div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> was arbitrary, it follows that our theorem holds for the triangular contour <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a polygonal contour, then we can add interior edges until the interior is subdivided into a finite number of triangles. The integral around each triangle is zero, and the sum of all these integrals equals the integral around the polygonal contour <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Therefore our theorem also holds for polygonal contours. The proof for an arbitrary simple closed contour is established by approximating the contour “sufficiently close” with a polygonal contour. We omit the details of this last step.</div>
