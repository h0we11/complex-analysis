<div class="para">Suppose there is no friction to slow down the motion of the mass, then we say that the system is <em class="emphasis">undamped</em>. We will determine the motion of this mechanical system by considering the forces acting on the mass during the motion. This will lead to a differential equation relating the displacement as a function of time. The most obvious force is that of <em class="emphasis">gravitational attraction</em> acting on the mass <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and is given by</div>

The next force to be considered is the <em class="emphasis">spring force</em> acting on the mass and is directed upward if the spring is stretched and downward if it is compressed.
