<div class="para">In 1918, the French mathematicians Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou noticed this fractal phenomenon when exploring iterations of functions not necessarily connected with Newton’s method. Beginning with a function <span class="process-math">\(f(z)\)</span> and a point <span class="process-math">\(z_0\text{,}\)</span> they computed the iterates</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
z_1=f(z_0), \, z_2=f(z_1), \, \ldots, \, z_{k+1}=f(z_k), \ldots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and investigated properties of the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{z_k\}\text{.}\)</span> Their findings did not receive a great deal of attention, largely because computer graphics were not available at that time. With the recent proliferation of computers, it is not surprising that these investigations were revived in the 1980s. Detailed studies of Newton’s method and the more general topic of iteration were undertaken by a host of mathematicians including Curry, Devaney, Douady, Garnett, Hubbard, Mandelbrot, Milnor, and Sullivan. We now turn our attention to some of their results by focusing on the iterations produced by quadratics of the form <span class="process-math">\(f_c(z) =z^2+c\text{.}\)</span> You will be surprised at the startling pictures that graphical iterates of such a simple function produce.</div>
