<div class="para">Because of what it erroneously connotes, it is a shame that the term <em class="emphasis">imaginary</em> is used in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_imaginary_part.html" title="Definition 1.2.9: Imaginary Part">Definition 1.2.9</a>. It was coined by the brilliant mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) during an era when quantities such as <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> were thought to be just that. Gauss, who was successful in getting mathematicians to adopt the phrase <em class="emphasis">complex number</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">imaginary number,</em> also suggested that we use <em class="emphasis">lateral part</em> of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in place of <em class="emphasis">imaginary part</em> of <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> Unfortunately, that suggestion never caught on, and it appears we are stuck with what history has handed down to us.</div>
