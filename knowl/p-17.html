<div class="para">So, by using Tartaglia’s work and a clever transformation technique, Cardano was able to crack what had seemed to be the impossible task of solving the general cubic equation. Surprisingly, this development played a significant role in helping to establish the legitimacy of imaginary numbers. Roots of negative numbers, of course, had come up earlier in the simplest of quadratic equations, such as <span class="process-math">\(x^2+1=0\text{.}\)</span> The solutions we know today as <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm \sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> however, were easy for mathematicians to ignore. In Cardano’s time, negative numbers were still being treated with some suspicion, as it was difficult to conceive of any physical reality corresponding to them. Taking square roots of such quantities was surely all the more ludicrous. Nevertheless, Cardano made some genuine attempts to deal with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\text{.}\)</span> Unfortunately, his geometric thinking made it hard to make much headway. At one point he commented that the process of arithmetic that deals with quantities such as <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> “involves mental tortures and is truly sophisticated.” At another point he concluded that the process is “as refined as it is useless.” Many mathematicians held this view, but finally there was a breakthrough.</div>
