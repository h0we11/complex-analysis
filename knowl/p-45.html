<div class="para">How does Wessel’s procedure lead to a geometric representation of complex numbers? Consider what happens if a unit vector is drawn from the origin straight up the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, and then multiplied by itself. By Wessel’s rules the length of the product vector is one unit, as the length of each factor is one unit. What about its direction? The angular displacement of the original vector is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</span> radians, so by Wessel’s rules again the product vector has a displacement of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi\)</span> radians. Thus, the product vector is aligned along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, but is directed from the origin <em class="emphasis">to the left</em> by one unit, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/wessel-4_fig.html" title="Figure 1.1.9">Figure 1.1.9</a>.</div>
